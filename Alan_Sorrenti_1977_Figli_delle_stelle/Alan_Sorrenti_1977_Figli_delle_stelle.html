   Little did I know that when I chose the only album of Sorrenti in my library system with the name Son Of The Stars of an artiste in our precious database, that I would end up with some semi-disco album that is best forgotten or stayed away from. Of course the album had a release date of 77, which might have given a first hint, and the album title had a double entendre and the artwork was doubtful. Nevertheless this fearless music explorer took the object home had was whacked across the head by dumb disco-beat easy listening music not far away from the Bee Gees.

   The worst part is that the opening title track does have a semi-proggish intro, raising your expectations up a tad, but soon after, the whole thing collapses as soon as the song proper kicks in an easy two beat. A little further down, the short (very) piano interlude might give you hopes for improvements especially recalling the "stars" thing (Stelle in Italian), as if it might be some kind of concept, but the following track is a boring MOR/AOR song, again ruining the hope. "Meeting in a Elevator" is more GIBBerish from Sorrenti, which has most of his older fans tearing their hairs out in despair. The funk-disco Casablanca doesn't dispels the unease towards this kind of album getting a release, while other artistes' best works are still un-issued. All of the songs really have a stinking disco tinge that makes me want to puke my guts out, but I'd rather listen to this gibberish than early 80's new wave electro-pop.
