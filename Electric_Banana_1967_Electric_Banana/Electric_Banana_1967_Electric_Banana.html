   As evidenced by their above resume, The Pretty Things were not a typical rock’n’roll band by any means.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And neither was their music: accordingly roughhewn and blessed without a hint of showbiz decorum that the 1964 pop world not only expected but demanded (the sole exception being their mercifully short-lived matching vest period) The Pretty Things defied all conventions every way they could... by oozing frustration from every pore that ranneth over and upon their earliest records in a spirited, slobbering mess of R&amp;B/blues that cut to the primal core. And they had the looks to match their brain-beating soundtrack: The lead singer possessed a tortured larynx on the inside and long hair way before the tresses of Rick Andridge, Wally Tax and Ozzy Osbourne (who he somewhat resembled) went similarly south. Their sharp-eared guitarist was bearded and looked twice as old as the others and had even done time in a proto-Stones band with Keith Richards. Their hooligan drummer was a baggy-eyed maniac who favoured pork pie hats and unpredictable behaviour both behind and in front of his kit while managing to take the lion’s share of most of the black mark’d indictments listed above. And finally, the other two members of this mob raked and plucked up a rickety racket behind it all while looking damaged in a similar manner Mick Jagger would muse years later over his own guitar-wielding cohorts. So it was little wonder that their concerts created riots because they WERE a riot. Or, as one contemporary source nailed it while introducing the band to a frothing crowd of hopped up beat fans: “A pretty girl is like a melody...My Pretty Things...are like a big sound!!”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And with an attitude as big to match, they let loose with an upstart sound that was likewise incorrigible as fuck and raw and minimal as a pile of saw-toothed, splintery planks banged together during an overnight booze-up into a cubist nightmare called ‘home’ AND it managed to keep the rain out and the hearth lit as an endless double tap of lager fitted with a pair of brass balls just kept on flowing (It just occurred to me I could’ve just as easily been describing The Pistols for the past couple of sentences, but never mind and onto the main creature feature: ‘fore I wind up entitling this whole shebang “Your Pretty Things Is A-Going To Hell (And It’s Hard To Beat)” or “Between Fontana &amp; Harvest: The Pretty Things Freak Out - 1967-1969” not least of all because I like a good cavort, but because that particular period of incubation was what set up and is integral to the period when The Pretties cut a hearty baker’s dozen on the side under the assumed alias of -- get this -- Electric Banana. I dunno know why, either except maybe because the boys were hard up after footing the production costs for the gatefold of ‘S.F. Sorrow” out of their own pockets once EMI passed the buck, no lie.)

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Anyway, I hope that this crash course on these ravers will be of some or at least little use to the rock’n’rollers, archivists, completists, and/or enthusiasts of the hard rock idiom out there because The Pretty Things during this point in time was a band whose creativity was on fire as they produced one hell of a series of hubbubs that connected the earliest R&amp;B rave-ups to primal garage punk puke-ups to psychedelia and heavy rock just before that junction of the sixties with the seventies. And since that comprises a huge chunk of the music I adore without reservation, well, here ‘tis...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Between the latter halves of 1967 and 1969, The Pretty Things found themselves at a crossroads that would turn out to be the headiest of their career in terms of experimental and artistic success, with an output littered throughout the most unlikely of places. Ranging from an abortive album backing a French millionaire, two film appearances, recording two outstanding psychedelic singles and the first concept album in Rock as all the while carrying on with a parallel career as a pseudonymous band for a film music archive, The Pretty Things could truly be said to have done it all within those two short years. It was as if their previous incarnation as pioneering aggro-fuelled R&amp;B primitives with several top UK hits under their belt belonged to a different entity altogether, and they would prove time and time again to be overqualified with adapting to each new musical situation they took on, which speaks great volumes regarding their determination and bottomless reserve of creative energy.

   At the onset of 1967, all that remained of the original lineup were vocalist Phil May and guitarist Dick Taylor, while Skip Alan was retained on drums since replacing founding drummer/looner module Vivian Prince two years earlier. Rounding out the lineup for the past year and a half were ex-Bern Elliot &amp; The Fenmen sidemen Wally Waller (bass, vocals and keyboards) and John Povey (keyboards as well as deputising on drums when the occasion called for it.) This five-piece continued until springtime of 1968 when Alan quit and was replaced by John “Twink” Alder, ex-drummer for The Fairies, In Crowd, Tomorrow and the recently departed studio group, The Aquarian Age. More than a capful of magic at the time, Twink brought along not only his drumming but a theatrical sense to The Pretties’ in-concert performances with pantomime, clambering atop amplifiers, waving ash wands at the audience and many other likeminded antics that enlivened the proceedings greatly with hobbity mindfucking galore.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But before this psychedelicising switch in the big beat department, the five-man Pretty Things experienced a major impetus for change with the recording of “Emotions,” their third and final album on Fontana. This transitory LP found them thrust wholesale into the unfamiliar world of commercial pop and although consequently written off by the band (May later pronounced it ‘a real lash up’) “Emotions” did at least hold the valuable experience of working with an outside influence when paired with arranger Reg Tilsley. Although his orchestral bent did unnaturally smooth over their former roughshod qualities, the experience did at least add another dimension to their considerable arsenal of R&amp;B/blues mixed with a loose cocktail of uncompromisin’ attitudinalisin’ that they had recently been throwing up lately on singles like “Get A Buzz” and “Midnight To Six Man.” But diametrically opposed to these ravers, deeply moody laments like the evocative “Can’t Stand The Pain” and the tough-but-tender-ballad-sneering of ‘You Don’t Believe Me” were served up simultaneously, casting an effective psychological contrast upon their records that would only grow.1
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   However, it was only temporarily that the rougher facet of The Pretty Things was waylaid by the light pop arrangements that dominated “Emotions,” as the balance quickly redressed itself with a total break from all previous manifestations when they took a sudden psychedelic nosedive with their first single for Columbia/EMI, “Defecting Grey”/“Mr. Evasion.” Originally demoed at over eight minutes in length and eventually shaved down to six (despite EMI’s petitioning to cut it down to three) both sides were driven by complex arrangements while its dense production colourations came courtesy of the label’s in-house producer, Norman Smith. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios where Smith had recently wrapped up engineering and production roles on “Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and “Piper At The Gates of Dawn,” the single bore unmistakable elements from both albums, combined with the significant acquisition (and subsequent psychedelic retooling) of Beach Boys-inf(l)ected harmony vocal modulations (circa topping The Beatles in the Melody Maker poll in the ‘Best Vocal Group’ category.) All three of these divergent strands came together with The Pretties’ own redoubtable strengths and were integrated with the seamless of ease on “Defecting Grey” as multi-layered overdubbing and multi-tiered passages kept shifting every other chorus into a different sequence of rave-up, freak out or knees up. The B-side was another saucerful of mystery majesties secrets altogether, as was the follow up “Talkin’ About The Good Times”/“Walking Through My Dreams.” And all four of these sides pointed to the destination that culminated with their most ambitious album to date: “S.F. Sorrow.” With even more expansive a breadth of production and vision, the album was based on a storyline conceived by May and work continued on the project for months at Abbey Road Studios. Experiments were hatched on the spot, in-house technicians wheeled in a battery of electronic concoctions to match the creativity already in the process of outdoing itself. But despite its stunning results, this now widely championed album wound up selling so poorly at the time of its release that it caused the now-confused Pretty Things to pause and bide their time before their next release...Which they did by working out new material under the cover of the Electric Banana alias.

   As previously mentioned, The Pretty Things had already begun to engage in recording a series of music library albums under this obtuse name for the archives of De Wolfe Music, a company that syndicated recordings worldwide for commercial use in film, television and radio. With a diverse selection of titles including “Industrial Complex” (‘Big industrial sounds by The International Studio Orchestra’), “Trend Setter” (‘The International Studio Orchestra in various moods’) and -- sound of a penny dropping -- “Tilsley Orchestra No. 4” (‘Big band and strings’) these albums were unavailable through retail music outlets, which is why the Electric Banana releases would remain all but unknown for the next ten years.

   1967’s ‘The Electric Banana’ and 1968’s ‘More Electric Banana.’ The albums include their tracks in both vocal and instrumental versions, offering producers and directors a choice for use in their projects as well as making for incredibly interesting listening for rock music fans. ‘Electric Banana’ has two tracks written by resident De Wolfe composer Peter Reno among its five tunes, and all contain brass arrangements by Reg Tilsley utilizing his Reg Tilsley Orchestral. The other three tracks, however, are Electric Banana originals and are symbolic of future band recordings, exhibiting the versatility of the group. Highlights of ‘The Electric Banana’ include Reno’s ‘Free Love’ which features a tasty guitar solo by Dick Taylor, the LP featuring Pretty Things members Phil May on lead vocals, Dick Taylor on lead guitar, Wally Waller on bass and John Povey on drums. The band’s name has been credited to a reference of Donovan’s description of a vibrator as an electrical banana in his hit ‘Mellow Yellow’ or a nod to smoking banana peels, the choice being left up to the listener.
