   Where did she go wrong? This 1977 album should have gone to CD. Bobbye Hall is now retired from the music business. But she's not gone. Come on, Bobbye! Get this album to CD! I think out of all the 70's albums I have, this has got to be the most interesting. First of all, she plays percussion. 2nd, she co-wrote all except 2 of the songs. The music is more experimental with out very much in the way of a melody. But the way everything blends is awesome. If you can get a record copy, then get it. Follow it up by sending it to Vinyl Revolution for transfer to CD.

   A very cool album of spacey soul jazz tracks! For years, we passed this one up because of a silly title and cover – but it's actually a fantastic album, with a feel that's kind of an extension of the Cadet studio sound of the late 60s. Dorothy Ashby plays harp on the album, and the group's led by percussionist Bobbye Hall. Andy Belling plays some pleasing keyboards, and he handled all of the arrangements in a very nice way. Tracks have a mellow easy groove that spreads out with a heck of a lot of soul.

   If Mike Oldfield composed in the realm of expansive, relaxed spiritual soul jazz, this is probably what his music would sound like. Beautiful tracks that segue into each other to create one continuous piece of music, this is a fantastic, overlooked album that's highly recommended to seekers of intelligent, exploratory and soulful music. And with Chuck Rainey on bass, Dorothy Ashby on harp, and mastering by Bernie Grundman---how much more cool musical pedigree do you need?
