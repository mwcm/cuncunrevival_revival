   Quite rare percussionist Airto Moreira's second album is a real heaven for every fan of early fusion/Latin jazz. Airto is in transition from his work in Weather Report towards Chick Corea's RTF and it's extremely interesting to hear how both his former and future bands's influences are presented here on his solo album.

   Music of "Seeds..." contains three main elements (almost in equal proportions): psychedelic fusion of Weather Report, strong Latin folk and jazz influence and Latin jazz-based fusion of early Return To Forever.Future RTF vocalist Flora Purim sings on this album with her easily recognizable voice(it sounds more raw and even screaming here)and in seconds listener can be mistaken like he listen to unknown early RTF composition. But just a moment after the difference becomes obvious - instead of Chick Corea's keyboards you can hear Brazilian star Hermeto Pascoal and their playing manner is quite different.All but one collaborated musicians are Brazilians (the only American is bassist Ron Carter)and all music has strong Latin taste. In fact, this album represents quite rare collaborative work of Brazilian jazz dream team (add percussionist Dom Um Romao,accordionist Sivuca and organist/violinist Severino de Oliveira to already mentioned Airto,Flora and Hermeto)plus bassist Ron Carter, and as it would be not enough all material is recorded in very early 70s, most adventurous time for fusion.

   Songs could be divided in three categories according to dominating influence - psychedelic fusion, Latin jazz/fusion and world fusion, without strict borders though.Psychedelic songs are probably most interesting since they sound as hardly imaginable mix between Weather Report debut's music and Brazil jazz. Latin jazz/fusion compositions, mostly with Purim vocals are great and easily recall her vocals on RFT debut just one year later. On world fusion compositions dominates Hermeto and Sivuca (Airto sings on one song)and this music sounds closer to them both solo works.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In all,unique release presenting brief transitional period in Airto career,soon he (together with Flora) will become Corea's RTF founding line-up members and then will continue solo careers as well. For Airto solo works,this Buddah release is way different from his later more polished albums on CTI.
