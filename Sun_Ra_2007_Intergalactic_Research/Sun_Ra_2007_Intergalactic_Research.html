   Two live performances from separate tapes by Sun Ra and his Arkestra. This is classic Ra at one of his strongest periods of time for the band. Intergalactic Research is a fully developed piece never previously released. There are only two other know unreleased recordings of this spectacular piece.

   Part of an ongoing series of releasing tapes from a variety of sources, the 57:07 features seven selections from a pair of concerts; Berkeley 1971 and an unknown location in 1972.

   A few ticks over 24 minutes comprise the three pieces from Berkeley, with saxophonist John Gilmore delivering an amazing solo on Untitled Improvisation and vocalist June Tyson taking center stage in a four-song sequence - but considered one number - that begins with Strange Worlds.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The 1972 concert is Sun Ra at his experimental best - Moog, Outer Space - with The Arkestra in full flight on an untitled track and Intergalactic Research.

   The Sun Ra concerts were very special experiences for the audience and this 2007 release takes the listener back to a time when a special connection was achieved through ground-breaking free jazz.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Like another great innovative jazz bandleader, Duke Ellington, the mercurial Sun Ra led a dizzying array of ensembles through countless performances and recordings that daunt even the most devout completists, but the LOST REEL series manages to unearth some great, previously unheard live and rehearsal tapes, mostly of early-1970s West Coast vintage. INTERGALACTIC RESEARCH, a '71 Berkeley concert recording that also includes some '72 material, finds Ra's cosmic keyboards interacting brilliantly with the post-Coltrane sax fury of John Gilmore and the otherworldly soul of vocalist June Tyson.
