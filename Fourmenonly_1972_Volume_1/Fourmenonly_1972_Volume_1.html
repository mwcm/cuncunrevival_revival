   Experimental jazz outfit fronted by pioneering German trumpet and flugelhorn player Herbert Joos. Their sound was well structured, more so than most other German ensembles from this period. Multitrack recording was used which generated controversial discussions among musicicians and fans alike. Being a non-professional ( meaning they weren't making a living with music) group they weren't fully taken seriuosly. Today their seminal work is acknowledged although they remain rather unknown with the exception of Herbert Joos. Fourmenonly were the direct successor of The Modern Jazz Quintet Karlsruhe. This happened when Claus Bühler left the group during a concert due to musical preferences.

   After the bassist left the the MODERN JAZZ QUINTET KARLSRUHE they continued as a quartet. On ESFS they added the trombone player Wolfgang Czelusta but still under their chosen name.

   The following words are from G.F. (thank you!) a fellow at Dime:"The last concert with Fourmenonly (with bass-player Johannes Schädlich with Wilfried Eichhorn, Helmut Zimmer and Rudi Theilmanm) happened in the early 80s in Karlsruhe - without Herbert Joos, who had left Karlsruhe and the others. Wilfried Eichhorn continued playing with the Frederic Rabold Crew in the late 70s (vocalist Lauren Newton started here!), and he played mostly in a Duo with pianist Uli Bühl in the 90s. Helmut Zimmer played mostly Bop Standards afterwards and occasionally still plays that kind of stuff. Rudi Theilmann is still active, playing mostly in Duo with violinist Helmut Bieler-Wendt. He participated since 1985 in another great free-improvising group, Dinkel-Frisch-Theilmann&amp;Bieler-Wendt, they recorded two albums in the late 80s."

   Herbert Joos himself worked in his own groups and ad hoc ensembles. Participated at a Free Jazz Meeting Baden-Baden. 1973 he made his first solo recording "The Philosophy Of The Fluegelhorn" on JAPO(ECM). On this lp he also uses multitracking to astounding effects. The music there is maybe "more" beautiful in a conventional manner. But never "sweet" - instead he shows a strong developed sense for harmonics and "Klangfarbe". Later he joined the Vienna Art Orchestra. Still active as a pro and going strong. I only want to add that the last track on "Vol.1" is one of my favourite pieces from this four astounding lps.
