   This is a surprising album as it represents a completely new sound for Kebnekajse, for better or for worse. The group experienced some line-up changes prior to this album when, among others, guitarist and front man Kenny Håkansson left. Instead, this is a very keyboard-heavy album, something Kebnekajse never had employed before. Unfortunately, this album sounds very much of it's time (Late 70s Sweden, this includes the cover.) and sometimes quite close to mainstream music of then. Otherwise it's a bit lightweight in the vein of THE ALAN PARSON'S PROJECT".

   Particularly the first track, "Friheten", sounds as it could have participated in Eurovision Song Contest of '79. "Jakten på Vivaldi", on the other hand, sounds more like the Kebnekajse I know. In general they make use of more conventional lyrics in a way new to Kebnekajse; almost half of the tracks are with vocals and it definitely contributes to the mentioned dated mainstream sound. The instrumental tracks are better but overall it's not that bad.

   ''Vi drar vidare'' marks the end of an era for the Swedish Folk/Prog pioneers with Kenny Håkansson leaving the band (apparently Netzler took over also the guitar duties), while for the first time keyboards are added via the coming of Per Lejring.So, this is old and new Kebnekaise in the mix, nice Scandinavian melodies with somewhat stripped-down guitars and efficient violin but also new entries with keyboard-flavored Fusion (organ, electric piano, synths) and Pop/Prog sounds, which work pretty fine.Sounds like a product of the time for the most of its part, but there was no direction to abandon their intricate musical themes.This album still contains interesting, Nordic-showered vibes and has plenty of instrumental exercises.They did hold on in my opinion.
