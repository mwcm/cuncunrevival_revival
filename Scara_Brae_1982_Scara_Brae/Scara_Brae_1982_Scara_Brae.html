   Not confuse them by the Irish folkband Skara Brae with almost an identical bandname.This is a bloody rare record strictly limited to 60 copies (as noticed on the backcover) by a band named Scara Brae located in the environment from Bremen in Germany.This album only exist as a testpressing and was never for sale.Only a very few copies were obtained from the bandmembers and appeared on the collectormarket.The funny thing is that the bassplayer Klaus Ihnen interviewed the Genesis members Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks in a radiostation in Bremen which resulted that they finally also participated on the longest track 'Little Nemo' with a duration time from 19'50''.It's not only an indispensable item for krautrock collectors, but also the ultimate item-collector for those die hard Genesis fans which would like to have it in their stash only to complete their Genesis discography.One of the top 3 of rarest German items together with the Pentagon acetate and the Petards related Johannes album.Musically it's a rocksession album, a mixture from several styles going from garage to progressive rock with amazing electrified ragtime explosions to churchmass weirdness.From jazz-and bluesrock to classical music interventions mixted in an amazing experimental adventure from unexpected weird soundcollages.The keyboards and bass from both Genesis members on the A-side are recognizable, but not symphonic as they usually are.In one word, musically totally not recommended for all those Genesis freaks, but an album destinated for the well travelled ears.Highly original and an uncompromising beauty to me.The bandname Scara Brae seems to be inspired from the neolithic village Skara Brae which is protected by the UNESCO and situated on the largest island from the Orkney archipel.
