   Sand dissolved sometime around 75', but history prooved they had much more to offer than one album.This unreleased compilation of recordings includes stuff for a never released second album as well as later compositions of Ludwig Papenberg and Johannes Vester.The music is somewhere in the middle between Kraut eletronics and Psych/Folk with an experimental edge.Lots of synthesizers, oscillators, cosmic effects to go along with psychedelic drumming, wordless voices and folky explorations.A bit more diverse than the debut and definitely more convincing.Fans of Experimental/Kosmische Prog will enjoy this one mostly.

   Previously unreleased album by German trio Sand, recorded 1973-1982. Live events in the quarry and an archaic sound formed the background music of the young atomic age. In the meantime, after endless trance garage sessions, Sand drifted from the mythical landscapes to Berlin and mingled with various oriental influences. Vultures were scudding along the urban canyons while burning houses illuminated the skyline. Sand navigated in obscure spheres and discovered Tendrara. There is something magical and inexplicable in creation, and Sand absolutely manifest these mysterious phenomena. Storytellers, musicians, shamans, geniuses -- Sand were known, at the end of the '60s, as P.O.T. (Part of Time). Then Sand -- Ludwig Papenberg, his brother Ulrich Papenberg, and Johannes Vester -- developed a more avant-gardist, proto-industrial, visionary, experimental approach, becoming a truly unique entity in the history of music. Not dependent on a classic krautrock style, Sand is nevertheless part of this movement of German cosmic/psychedelic bands, in addition to being the originators of proto-industrial musics. Johannes Vester: lyrics, vocals , synthesizers, guitar, organ, harmonium. Ludwig Papenberg: synthesizers, organ, generator, guitar, bongos. Ulrich Papenberg: bass. Guests: Christa Schunke, chorus; Claudia Utke, synthesizer; Dietmar Burmeister, drums; Jörg Hahnfeld, acoustic guitar; Klaus Pankau, electric and acoustic guitars; Martine Rossi-Merue, vocals; Michael (Micky) Westphal, bass. Remastered by Hervé de Keroullas, 2008. Graphic Design by Frédéric Tacer, 2011. Cover painting by Babs Santini, 2009. CD in six-panel digipak.
