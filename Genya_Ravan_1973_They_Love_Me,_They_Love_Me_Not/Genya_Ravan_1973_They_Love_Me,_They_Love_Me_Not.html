   The 1973 ABC/Dunhill LP now on CD, Genya Ravan's 2nd Solo album contains some good music. It gets off to a bang with GOTTA TELL SOMEBODY [ 'BOUT MY BABY ], a horn filled fast paced rocker not unlike her TEN WHEEL DRIVE songs. Eric Clapton's KEEP ON GROWING is amazing, a perfect rock song for Genya to get a hold of. Sheryl Crow's version pales in comparison to Genya's rocking growl, and this track just grooves. MISSY [MISTER ] is really different with both soft and loud passages, like Genya with 2 different personalities. This really works to great effect and mood. SOUL CELEBRATION is another rollicking mid-tempo highlight. And THAT CRYIN' RAIN takes care of things in the ballad department on this release really nicely.

   The other songs are mainly shorter songs in a rock vein with catchy choruses like UNDER CONTROL and DON'T PRESS ME. WHEN YOU GOT TROUBLE is a bluesy wailer, but more of a repeated mantra than an actual song, which would have been much better. It segueways into the very short YOU GOT THE BLUE, just really a track tagged onto the end of TROUBLE. JIMMY MILLER , noted for his work with The Rolling Stones produced a few tracks, and then JIM PRICE produced the bulk of this album. It's good to hear Genya in the mid-70's, paving the way for so many other female rockers. She may not have gotten the big notices for this album the first time around, but it's worth owning. Cover art illustrates her humor and power as a sexually experienced woman, hence the title THEY LOVE ME, THEY LOVE ME NOT.

   The Japanese import is a replica of the original gatefold cover, with the lyrics &amp; photo inside. There are also liner notes in Japanese. They really should translate it into English as well. No bonus tracks, as this was her only album for ABC/Dunhill.
