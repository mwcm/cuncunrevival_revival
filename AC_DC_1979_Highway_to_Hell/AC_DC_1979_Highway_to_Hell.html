   February 19, 1980, AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott passed away. The news of Scott’s unexpected passing spread quickly, with conflicting reports regarding the actual cause of death. Pronounced dead-on-arrival at King’s College Hospital in Cumberland, England, following an evening out-on-the-town and out-of-his-mind with UFO bassist Pete Way, the coroner noted that Bon had died as a result of acute alcohol poisoning. In the hard rock ranks, the sneering Scott was looked-upon as indestructible. However, hangin’ with the legendary Pete “Waysted” Way can take its toll on anybody, as evident by the tragic death by misadventure of the legendary AC/DC front man.

   Shortly before Bon Scott’s death, Atlantic Records had issued AC/DC’s “Touch Too Much” as a single. “Touch Too Much” was pulled from the group’s most popular album to date, the caustic Highway to Hell LP. Highway to Hell finally broke AC/DC in North America, peaking at number 17 in the states, after previous recordings from the hard-wired act failed to crack the top 100.

   Clearly AC/DC was on the rise in '79, when the competition in the hard rock ranks, such as Aerosmith, KISS and Ted Nugent, were faltering as the ‘80s approached. AC/DC’s back catalog began to move major units on the strength of Highway to Hell. AC/DC was on the verge of taking their high-voltage raunch ‘n’ roll to a new level before the devastating news of Scott’s death was confirmed. Gone, but never forgotten, at the age of 33, Angus and Malcolm Young eventually decided to keep AC/DC plugged-in as a tribute to the hard-livin’ memory of Bon.

   From my humble, ear-ringing perspective, the no-frills Powerage LP, which opens with “Rock ‘n’ Roll Damnation”, and packs-on “Riff Raff”, “Sin City” and “Down Payment Blues”, is the definitive studio release from AC/DC’s long-way-to-the-top run with Bon at the point. However, there is no denying the fact that Highway to Hell was the album that pushed the no-nonsense group to the front.

   To truely appreciate Highway to Hell, you have to consider how depressed the hard rock scene had become as the dazed 'n' confused decade came to a close. Issued in July of 1979, the instantaneous riff that drives the red hot title track hooks the listener from the off, setting the stage for a kick-ass cruise of bitchin’ jeans ‘n' t-shirt rawk ‘n’ fuckin’ roll. Highway to Hell was made for long hair, beer-chuggin' teens, by down-to-earth blues-based hard rockin’ punters. AC/DC kicked-out bad boy boogie with the best of ‘em.

   AC/DC cut their teeth on Chuck Berry licks, adding a metallic edge to their bare-bones assault as the years progressed, but the boys never forgot their roots. After years of studio work under the production watch of Harry Vanda and George Young, AC/DC turned to produced Robert John “Mutt” Lange when it came time to lay-down the tracks for Highway to Hell. However, prior to collaborating with Lange, AC/DC languished in the studio with producer Eddie Kramer. It wasn't in the cards, as Kramer suggested the addition of keyboards. AC/DC doesn't need fucking keyboards! End of discussion, and Kramer was shown the door.

   Lange’s work from start-to-close captures AC/DC hitting on all cylinders. The bitchin’ “Girls Got Rhythm” follows the amped-up, hellbound opener, delivering the goods in spades for three-plus-minutes of sexually charged action. Scott’s take-no-shit lyrics power the hard hitting “Walk All Over You”, while “Touch Too Much” is jacked-up behind a potent groove. The hyper “Beating Around the Bush” is a throwback to the group’s early sound, which gives way to the blistering “Shot Down in Flames”. AC/DC bring the heat on the album’s shortest song, “Get It Hot”, and bang out “If You Want Blood (You’ve Got It)” with aggression. The mid-paced “Love Hungry Man” counters the sonic onslaught with a loose blooze slide. It is only fitting that the haunting, full-moon chill of “Night Prowler” closes out the last official AC/DC recording with rough ‘n’ tough Bon Scott on vocals. Bon carries the six-minute "Night Prowler" via a dark, make-a-mess-of-you vocal performance.

   As I finish listening to the album, I can only think that Bon Scott lived the stereotypical lifestyle of a rock idol: He rocked hard, lived fast, and died young. All told, he is a rock god, and his final album is a testament to his, and his band's, greatness.
