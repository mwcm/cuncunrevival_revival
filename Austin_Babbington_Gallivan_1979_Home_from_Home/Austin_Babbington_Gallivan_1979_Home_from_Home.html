   Here is a trio recording from 1977, released on the Ogun label in 1979. This is a set of quiet, emphathetic sketches, most of them fairly short, at least by jazz standards. Chamber jazz might be a word to describe what we hear on this record. Not the stuff to leap at you, but to grow insidiousaly after repeated listenings. Quite a fine little gem, in my humble opinion. Nice flute playing with an oriental touch, sinuous electric bass to the fore and there is even a synth creeping in on several tracks.

   Charles Austin and Joe Gallivan have cooperated a lot over the years and both are active up to the present date. Austin is a resident of New Orleans and devoting more time to teaching than to playing in later years. Gallivan played with several stalwarts on the UK jazz scene while living in the UK for some years in the 70s, but also made a memorable album with Larry Young, well worth seeking out. Babbington was associated with the Canterbury scene in the 70s, playing in one version of Soft Machine, but also with Elton Dean and Keith Tippett and later with Barbara Thompson.
