  Their second album contained their massive hit "Bend Me Shape Me" (ironically, British horn-driven band AMEN CORNER, also recorded this song).
  <br/>
  It's strange how different they looked in one year's passing. They must have had a makeover at the hands of Dot Records management.
  <br/>
  The songs are far better than on the first album.
  <br/>
  Their version of The Monkees'"Sometimes in the Morning" is just as good as Micky Dolenz's sung classic. Their version of Chuck Jackson's "Something You Got" smokes! Containing a stop-start drum break "Don't give the drummer some, give it to me!!!"  Their version of The Impressions'"I've Been Trying" can bring you to tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rest of the album is top-notch gritty Chicago garage rock. I can't give more honors to this classic!
