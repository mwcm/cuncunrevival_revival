   A holy grail for Hendrix fans. Live cuts and studio rarities from his years with The Experience (which everyone rightfully acknowledges was his best lineup). Some of the alternate versions are too close to the album versions for them to appeal to casual fans but Hendrix fanatics will find them fascinating. But the real treat are the unreleased studio cuts and live tracks. Highlights from the former category are early sketches of "Little Wing", "Midnight Lamp""Lover Man" and "Have You Ever Been", a energetic backing track only known as "Title # 3", and a rare later-period groove called "Cherokee Mist". From the latter category we have killer covers of "Johnny B. Goode", "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Sgt. Pepper" and the ultimate version of "Red House", which includes some of Jimi's best soloing (no exaggeration). A must-hear for all obsessives.
