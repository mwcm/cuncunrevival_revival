   With Dunhill demanding another LP, Emmit Rhodes found himself forced back into the recording studio without a lot of time to prepare new material. . Like the debut, "Mirror" was another true solo effort with Rhodes writing, producing and handling all of the instrumentation. Given the intense pressure he was under, Rhodes actually acquitted himself withhonors. While the McCartney comparison remained apt (check out 'Side We Seldom Show'), the set was actually more varied than the debut. While ballads such as 'Love Will Stone You' and the title track boasted wonderful melodies, 'Birthday Lady', 'Really Wanted You', and 'My Love Is Strong' demonstrated Rhodes was just as accomplished  when it came to churning out rockers. Truth be told, this one was every bit as good as the debut, though peaking at # 182 it was a disappointing seller.   You were left to wonder what he could have done given the time and resources to record a quality sophomore album.

   Following the critical success of his debut solo album, Emitt Rhodes, the one man Beatles, entered his home studio for the follow-up, and he did not disappoint. Although not as cohesive as his last record, Mirror is home to some of his finest material. "Birthday Lady" and "Really Wanted You" are almost Stones-like in their attack, aggression, and feel, and Rhodes pulls them off with fantastic results. "Golden Child of God" is also one of his finest compositions -- it also would have easily been at home on Paul McCartney's Ram. All in all, this album is not a disappointment, coming off his self-titled debut Emitt Rhodes, which can easily be described as one of the classics of the period.
