   The majority of this record is pretty clean, smooth jazz-funk, with tracks like "Baia (Boogie Bump)" taking on the jazz-disco fusion style that would've fit in right alongside any number of CTI Records releases from around the same time. Not that that should be a surprise, since Kudu was sort of Creed Taylor's farm camp for upcoming talent. Unlike Muhammad's later records like Boogie to the Top, though, this one keeps the track lengths in check and leaves enough focus on the musicians to keep things loose and more jazz-y; dig George Young and Fred Wesley's solos on "Hard to Face the Music," or the colors Sir Roland Hanna adds to "Theme for New York City" with his atmospheric playing.

   What makes this entire record worth the price of admission, though, is the 11-minute cut "Sudan," Idris Muhammad's crown jewel both in terms of his original compositions and in terms of his performance, which is just otherworldly tight and precise. While he was largely known for his fills and ability to turn in a consistent backing beat that was energetic and funky, on "Sudan" Muhammad lets the ever-ponderous Hanna and the nervous bass of Wilbur Bascomb do the heavy rhythmic lifting as he explores his kit in strange and increasingly exciting ways. Just the way he changes the beat while Bascomb plays more or less the same riff over and over again re-casts the horns' melodic theme in a new light every time it re-emerges. "Sudan" sometimes seems like about 5 different songs at once, only connected by some of the funkiest playing ever heard on a jazz record. It's an absolute masterpiece, one of the finest soul-jazz tracks ever recorded, and even if the rest of the album is pretty much only recommended for fanatics of that genre everyone owes it to themselves to experience those 11 minutes of brilliance.

   The album starts out with a real funky soulful jazzy uptempo 'House of The Rising Sun', like I have never heard before, and I have heard this song lots, one of the very first songs I learnt to play. It's given a real refreshing sound and takes a big group to do that. This album has many musicians who all add to its greatness (Joe Beck, David Sanborn, Michael Brecker, Hugh McCracken, Bob Berg, Fred Wesley and Patti Austin just some of them) and right in the middle is Idris Muhammad's drumming. The album switches gears on the second track 'Bahia' which has some fantastic horn arrangements, with Fred Wesley on trombone, and it has a chorus of girls singing making it fit for an outdoor beach party. This tune is a Brazilian jazz classic. Ashford and Simpson's 'Hard to Face the Music,' is up next, great track as is the 'Theme for New York City,' but the gem here, and where Idris really shines, is on 'Sudan' and its over 11 minutes long, that puts a smile on my face. He is a fabulous drummer. The perfect trumpet playing on this track, one of the best soul jazz tracks I have ever heard, reminds me of Freddie Hubbard, but its not, its a guy named Tom Harrell, check out his 1989 album Sail Away. The album ends with the Meters''Hey Pocky A-Way,' down and dirty funk. I like the variety a lot on this Rudy Van Gelder engineered album.
