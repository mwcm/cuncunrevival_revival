   Black Spirit is an italian band formed in 1970. After a few successfully live performances the band moves to Germany in order to sign their first release on Brutkasten (1978). Lately, this ultra rare effort has been re-issued Ohrwaschl. The band essentialy played in Germany until 1978. Musically speaking their sound is rather different than the lyrical and luminous italian prog rock. It is bluesy-hard-rockin music with discreet proggy tendances and krauty-psych sounding.

   Despite the fact that they are Italian, Black Spirit figure among the exceptions in term of musical signature. Their own sound is at million miles away from the usual luxurious, neo-baroco and lyrical Italian progressive rock scene. In reality it's not so surprising because the album has been signed on a german label. The band is stylisticaly connected with trippy-kraut excentricies, mainly with the bluesy-heavy side of the genre (Birth Control, Electric Sandwich...). Their music is a nice and intuitive mixture of dynamic krauty improvs with harsh garagey guitar rhythms, discreet epic vintage keyboards, sometimes punctuated by pop-ish nervous vocals. Crazy Times starts as a basic rockin piece and progressively goes into a furious psychedelic blues rock jamming session, including perpetual guitar solos and solid repetitive rhythms. The two following tracks Punk Rock'n Roll and Nicolino are ultra fuzzy garagey hard rockin pieces. Old times closes the album with a playful blues rock improvisation based on screaming fuzz guitar sequences. The last minutes feature a great dose of emotional-moody organ chords. Not so good but spontaneous with lot of fun.
