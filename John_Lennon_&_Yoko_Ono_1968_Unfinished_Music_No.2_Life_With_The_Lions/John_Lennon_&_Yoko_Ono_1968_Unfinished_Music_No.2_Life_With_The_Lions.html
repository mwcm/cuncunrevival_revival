   The second long player of experimental sounds by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Unfinished Music No 2: Life With The Lions was released on the Zapple label in May 1969.
  </div>

   The follow-up to Unfinished Music No 1: Two Virgins continued the couple's attempt to present their lives together as artistic statements. The first half was an avant-garde jazz performance recorded live at Cambridge University, while the second documented their stay in London's Queen Charlotte Hospital in 1968.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album was the first to be released on The Beatles' label Zapple, intended as an experimental counterpart to Apple. It was issued on the same day as George Harrison's Electronic Sound.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Cambridge 1969 was a 26-minute piece featuring Ono on wailing vocals and Lennon coaxing numerous shades of feedback from his guitar amplifier, recorded on 2 March 1969. For the final six minutes they were joined by saxophonist John Tchicai and percussionist John Stevens, who continued playing for a time after Lennon and Ono left the stage.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album's second half was recorded after Ono was admitted to hospital on 4 November 1968. During her stay Lennon remained at her side, sleeping in a spare hospital bed until it was needed for another patient; he subsequently slept on the floor.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Over the next fortnight they made a series of recordings. No Bed For Beatle consisted mostly of Ono singing snippets of press articles about the couple, with Lennon doing the same in the background. The track is followed by Baby's Heartbeat, a five-minute audio recording of the couple's unborn child.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On 21 November 1968 Ono suffered a miscarriage, which was attributed to stress caused by the couple's recent arrest for drugs possession and the backlash they received from the media. The child was named John Ono Lennon II, and was later buried in a secret location.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Two Minutes Silence follows; its contents are self-explanatory. Interestingly, in 1973 the couple released another silent track, Nutopian International Anthem on the Mind Games album, which followed their announcement of Nutopia, a conceptual country.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The final track on Life With The Lions is Radio Play, more than 12 minutes of a radio being turned on and off by Ono. Lennon can be heard in the background speaking on the telephone, and at one point The Beatles' Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da can be heard.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A 1997 compact disc reissue included to additional recordings made at Queen Charlotte Hospital. Song For John is a relatively conventional song featuring Ono singing over Lennon's acoustic guitar backing, while Mulberry has Lennon on slide guitar while Ono repeats the title word for nine minutes.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Lennon and Ono appeared on The David Frost Show in London on 14 June 1969, in which they talked about Unfinished Music No 2: Life With The Lions, as well as their peace campaigns.

   If John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band is considered to be one of the most honest recordings ever released by a popular music superstar, then what is Life with the Lions?  The disdain of this album, particular among hardcore Beatle fans, is easy to understand.  Performers of some of the most wonderful pop/rock songs of all-time, Life with the Lions possesses no signs of harmony, rhythm or traditional song-structure whatsoever.  Since the greatest strengths of Lennon or McCartney are nary present here, it's easy to comprehend the adverse reaction many listeners have to this album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But for those remaining listeners who really want some insight into the machinations of a global celebrity who has fallen in love and married a woman the world despises (possibly because she's a strong woman with feminist ideals, a Dada-ist artistic ethos, and Japanese [not the white, blond, blue-eyed trophy expected to drape the arm of a Beatle]), who has just suffered with her through the pain of miscarriage, and who is given no peace from the media, the music industry or people who just want a piece of their idol during this entire ordeal, then Life of the Lions is a necessary listening experience.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The centerpiece is "Cambridge 1969," John Lennon's first serious leap into the musical avant-garde as a guitar player.  Spewing feedback, at times pitchperfect with Yoko Ono's shrieking howl, this anti-music is more cathartic than any of the Sonic Youth guitar freakouts that would follow fifteen to twenty years later.  John Tchichai strengthens the avant-garde connection by contributing some free sax in the last minutes of the track.  Superior to similar output on Live Peace in Toronto 1969, an album mired by the superstar gala surrounding it (and the incompetent support of Eric Clapton and Alan White, who were clearly out of their element), "Cambridge 1969" is much more successful as an experimental piece of music than much of the "psychedelic" stuff passed off for innovative at that time.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The flip-side, though somewhat lacking in originality, is raw, and often too painful to listen to.  "No Bed for Beatle John" features Yoko Ono reading from newspaper articles about her husband in a lullaby voice ill-fitting of the content she is reading.  This is followed by the tragic "Baby's Heartbeat," a loop of the heartbeat of John &amp; Yoko's miscarried child, creating immediate discomfort in the listener for prying into the private lives of these people.  The soothing, hypnotic sounds of the heart are rendered violent and cacophonous by the lo-fi recording on this track.  The final two tracks steal ideas from John Cage.  But where Cage's music is often brutally intellectual, "Two Minutes Silence" and "Radio Play" are completely visceral.  On the latter track, a beat-up transistor radio is manipulated to produce static beats, while in the background, we hear Lennon and Ono discussing business and taking phone calls.  This is performance art: for these Warhol-era superstars, the line between art and quotidian reality is so blurry that notions of self become immediately outdated.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is a harsh, difficult recording to listen to.  Its challenge lies in its separation of art (and pop-cultural myth) from lived experience, of music from noise, of silence from sound.  How many albums can you think that do this?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Yet another Lennon/Ono masterpiece. This time the album includes actual music. But listen to the sonic soundscapes as well, like Radioplay and Baby's Heartbeat. Awesome stuff!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Yes, it is an acquired taste. But if you taste it long enough, you will want more!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Play it on headphones. Simply awesome.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Their second masterpiece.
