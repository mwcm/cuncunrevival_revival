   RALF NOWY (1940-2007) was born in Berlin. By 18 he had, with fellow students, founded his first rock &amp; roll band. He soon decided to make a serious commitment to music and so went to Stern Conservatory in Berlin where he extensively studied classical music, jazz, performing composition and arrangement.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   Whilst studying music, he performed in various free-jazz bands on the flute and saxophone, and began to compose. He continued to play and compose after his studies and in 1963 he won best soloist prize (flute and saxophone) at the Berlin Jazz Festival. Not long after, he accepted the position of musical director of Berlin's Forum Theatre which game him more opportunities to compose.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   In 1968 he became the production manager and program director of Saarbrücken's Saarländischer Rundfunk dance orchestra which led to various music studios calling for his services and it led to his collaboration with many artists.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   By 1970 he worked as an independent composer, producer and arranger. He began work with the Olympics production company and directed and arranged a number of music productions for GIORGIO MORODER (Moroder, of course, was a very successful soundtrack composer who did the terrific scored for films such as Midnight Express and Cat People).
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   Nowy composed for various artists popular in Germany during the 70s and created many jingles for advertising (including Tic-Tac and Pepsi) and composed various film scores in the early 70s as well as directed various musical tour events such as SHIRLEY BASSEY's. He was much much in demand as a producer and arranger and worked in a wide variety of music with a wide a wide variety of artists. He also played with many live bands at the time and did session musician work.

   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   In 1973, he produced his first album under his name (RALF NOWY), which was a sort of German supergroup sometimes called the Nowy group (he had various very talented musicians working with him from the Munich music scene), and is an, I think, rather devilishly good, "LUCIFER'S DREAM". This dreamy album was influenced by the burgeoning Krautrock scene and employed Eastern styles, a pastoral, classical influence, big band type jazz, psyche, pop and rock (with some disco groove thrown in). It's eclectic qualities no doubt stemming to some extent from the range of musicians that Nowy had worked with, as well as those he was working with on the album. as well as the range of styles Nowy was interested in. The musicians he worked with on "LUCIFER"S DREAM" include KEITH FORSEY who has worked on albums by Achtzehn Karat Gold; Amon Düül II; Don Anderson; Cherubin; Family Tree; Gebrüder Engel; Hallelujah; Roland Kovac New Set; Lindenberg, Udo; Motherhood; Niagara; Persiko &amp; Co; Tanned Leather; Utopia; and Paul Vincent, as well as ALOIS GROMER who worked on albums by/ with Amon Düül II; Between; and Popol Vuh, plus GARY UNWIN who worked with Cherubin; Family Tree; Niagara; and Paul Vincent, and PAUL VINCENT who worked with Don Anderson; Family Tree; Hallelujah; Motherhood; Niagara; Subject Esq.; Tanned Leather and Waldemar Wunder Syndikat.

   He also released two albums in 1973 under the title ORCHESTER RALF NOWY (but this is a separate project) called "DILLY DALLY DANCING" and "DILLY DANCING 2" made in glorious "Loving Stereo". I haven't heard these, but they appear to be, surprise, surprise, pop dance albums. Yes, truly Nowy was a Renaissance man -- comfortable in the halls of free jazz, classical, rock, folk, ad jingles, pop, soul and disco.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   His next album, now under the moniker NOWY, "ESCALATION", would be less Krautrock and more jazz-rock, and more accessible, with an Eastern flavour. It features THOR BALDURSSON of AMON DUUL II and VIKTOR BEHRENS of AMON DUUL II and NIAGARA as well as KEITH FORSEY of AMON DULL II, NIAGARA, HALLELUJAH and UTOPIA. It also has GARY UNWIN of NIAGARA and PAUL VINCENT of NIAGARA AND HALLELUJA.

  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   The third (or the second under the moniker NOWY), "NOWY 2" is more funk with soul and disco qualities. It's a poppy album. MICHAEL THATCHER of OUT OF FOCUS joins in on this one.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   He then got more into disco, and released the single "ROCK 'N ROLL VAMPIRE/ GAZPACHO"" which is fun (it was an Italian "single" release).
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   "EARLY ENCOUNTERS" is more of an easy listening album which may have a similar effect on some as KENNY-G does on me. Makes me kind of sleepy.
  </div>
  <div>
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   He has released a total of 13 albums under his name and continued to work in music up until his death.
