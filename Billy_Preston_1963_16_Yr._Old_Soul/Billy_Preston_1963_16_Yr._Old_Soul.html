   For all of the unabridged amazement surrounding Billy Preston’s high school-aged mastery of both the bubbling jazz of Jimmy Smith and the lean Memphis R&amp;B of Booker T. Jones, the truth is, he’d been at this a while.

   When Derby released the aptly titled 16 Year Old Soul five decades back, Preston had already made an unforgettable contribution to Sam Cooke’s ageless blues project Night Beat, adding his own organ-based barnyard asides to a simmering new take on “Little Red Rooster.” Prior to that, Preston had served as the choir director at his mothers church going back to the tender age of five.

   He appeared on Nat King Cole’s television variety program, singing “Blueberry Hill,” toured Europe with Little Richard (where Preston began a life-long friendship with the Beatles) — and even played the childhood version of W.C. Handy for a 1958 biopic called St. Louis Blues.

   16 Year Old Soul wasn’t even Billy’s first recording. That honor went to the tiny Contract label out of Hollywood, which released a pair of largely forgotten early 45s. Still, his debut on Cooke’s fledgling label (started with J.W. Alexander, of the Pilgrim Travelers; and S.R. Crain, of his Soul Stirrers) is generally understood to be the beginning point of Preston’s legend — the moment when many first came to know the boundless talent, enthusiasm, joy and marrow-deep groove that surrounded his work at the organ.

   A mixture of covers and original material — including Preston’s first single for Derby, the appropriately named “Greazee” — 16 Year Old Soul found Billy surrounded by a group of ace sessions guys, including drummer Earl Turner and guitarist Tommy Tedesco, among others.

   He returns with a swinging update of “Lost and Lookin’,” which had earlier appeared on Cooke’s Night Beat,; transforms “I Can’t Stop Loving You” (which had just become a crossover hit for Ray Charles) into a girder-rattling groover; finds the heart-opening gospel centerpoint of Cooke’s “Bring It On Home To Me”; and threatens to shake the studio loose of its foundation on his own hard-charging “Ain’t That Love” — the last of which serves as a small glimpse into the afro-shaking funk to come. This new reissue is rounded out by two rare bonus cuts, both of them instrumentals.

   Most listeners only became aware of Billy Preston as a solo artist after he signed to Apple Records in the late 1960s. But he'd been recording for a long time prior to that, dating back to when he was a teenager. This instrumental album for Sam Cooke's SAR label (issued on its sister Derby imprint) was cut in March 1963, when Preston was still going to high school in Los Angeles. The very fact that it's wholly instrumental indicates that it's pretty early in Preston's evolution, and though he does play some piano, it's really on the more uptempo, organ-dominated tunes where he hits the best groove. In truth, these aren't any great shakes even when it comes to soul organ instrumentals, but they have a nice swinging bounce that places them a cut above period background music, though they fall a good ways short of being spellbinding. The slower numbers (including covers of hits by Sam Cooke and Ray Charles) verge on easy listening; in contrast, the more urgent cuts are cookin', with bop, jazz, and gospel influences spicing up the soul/R&amp;B recipe. Preston didn't write much of the material, but one of the numbers on which he's credited as a co-composer, "Good News," is a highlight. [The 2011 CD reissue on ABKCO adds a couple of bonus tracks, one of them a cover of Cooke's "Win Your Love for Me."]
