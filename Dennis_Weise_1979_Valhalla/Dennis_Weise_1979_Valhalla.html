  Here's another album that seems to have disappeared from the face of the internet. I think I probably got it off the Mutant Sounds blog back in the day (credit where credit's due) but obviously that link is long-gone. So, here ya go...

   Dennis Weise ( a/k/a Dr.Wize) is an accomplished musician, composer, keyboardist, and vocalist. He studied music at Trinity College under the illustrious modern classical composer, Samuel Barber. He later earned a doctorate at the United States International/ Alliant University in San Diego. When not performing, Dennis is a practicing psychologist in West Palm Beach, Florida.

   In 1978 he recorded with jazz giant Herbie Hancock on “Rock-it”, Columbia Records best-selling extended play single. He also performed with the progressive European band Gong, and recorded with the Wailers band members in the famed Tough Gong studio in Jamaica in 1982. Next Dennis independently produced two solo albums “Valhalla” (1979), and “Consciousness Program” (1980), and recorded original music for the Eurock: “American Music Compilation” album (1982). His first ambient CD entitled “Towards the One” was released in 1995, distributed in the US by Valley Recordings. Dennis' band recorded the follow up “Corps of Discovery” (1998), and “Anima Manna” (2000). While Dennis' earlier work tended toward ambient electronica, the influence of dance music can be heard in his later work.

   This is really fucking strange stuff. The first time I heard it, I assumed it was some obscure library release, because it's pretty heavy on the analog synths and soundtrack vibes. But, it's apparently not that...it's a private press release that is intended to be an 'album.' More or less, it's almost like an outsider music version of Faust or something. This guy clearly digs krautrock but the musicianship is amateurish. Songs go nowhere, and often do about-faces for no particular reason.

   When it's good, though (as on 'Alien Rock') it is VERY good. A must hear for all fans of 70's private press weirdness, the Residents, or library music. Also, the track subtitled '93rd Current' would seem to indicate that Weise is either a fan of Aleister Crowley, or he has some connection to the group Current 93 (who weren't formed til '82...about 4 years after this record came out)

   This brainburning floorsucking acid mindbomb's unprecedented conflation of liquidly phasing astral keys, searing sustain guitar and unhinged avant-rock structural permutations is one for the ages. You can catch bits of everything from The Cosmic Jokers to Bomis Prendin to The High Fidelity Orchestra to Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come within this kaleidoscopic cyclotron. Strong, strong medicine. Avoid operating heavy machinery when caught in it's vortex.
