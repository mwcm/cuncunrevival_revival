  Track 8 (unknown to Douglas) was a composite of three different bits, of unrelated tracks put together posthumously in 1973 by John Jansen. These were variously recorded at Electric Lady, NYC, in July/August 1970 (possible recording date for the intro); at Record Plant, NYC, January 23, 1970 (the middle Ezy Ryder/MLK Jam); and at TTG Studios, Los Angeles, Ca. on October 23, 1968 (the New Rising Sun outro). Douglas added overdubs to Jansen's original

   Before Hendrix died in 1970, he was in the final stages of preparing what he intended to be a double studio LP, which was given various titles such as 'First Rays of the New Rising Sun', 'People, Hell &amp; Angels', and 'Strate Ahead' [sic]. Most of the tracks intended for this LP were spread out over three posthumous single LP releases: The Cry of Love (1971), Rainbow Bridge (1971), and War Heroes (1972). In the case of the last two of these LPs, a demo track, a live track, and unreleased studio tracks were used to fill out the releases. In late 1973, his international label prepared to issue an LP titled Loose Ends which contained eight tracks, six of which were generally regarded as incomplete or substandard (the only two "finished" tracks on this release were "The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice", a heavily re-mixed stereo version of the B-side which had been released in the original mono mix on the 1968 European and Japanese versions of the Smash Hits, and a cover of Bob Dylan's "The Drifter's Escape", both of which would ultimately be re-released on the South Saturn Delta CD in 1997). Loose Ends was not released in the USA by Reprise because they considered the quality of the tracks to be subpar.

   Hendrix had amassed a great deal of time in the studio in 1969 and 1970, resulting in a substantial amount of songs, some close to completion, that were available for potential release. After the death of Hendrix' manager in 1973, Alan Douglas was hired to evaluate hundreds of hours of remaining material that was not used on earlier posthumous albums. "Peace in Mississippi,""Somewhere," and "Stone Free" were recorded with the original Jimi Hendrix Experience line up, while the rest of the material used on Crash Landing consisted of recordings Hendrix originally made with Billy Cox on bass and either Mitch Mitchell or Buddy Miles on drums and on one occasion by Rocky Isaacs.

   In 1974, Time magazine ran an article entitled "The Hendrix Tapes." At the end of this bombastic piece, the magazine claimed that "some 600 to 800 hours' worth were shipped off to a warehouse and forgotten. Last spring, having issued three posthumous Hendrix LPs and run out of material, Warner Bros. Records asked a former Hendrix producer, Alan Douglas, if he knew of any other tapes." It seems Douglas did, and he'd even "listened to 250 hours' worth of reels and thinks he has enough stuff for several albums. For now, he is concentrating on five LPs, the first scheduled to be issued in October, so that all who still care can get to know Jimi's kind of music."

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Jimi had been gone for four years at this point. Mitch Mitchell and Eddie Kramer had released three posthumous collections of unreleased Jimi tracks. Due to a set of pesky contracts signed by manager Mike Jeffery, Jimi's vision of a double LP was scrapped. By the time War Heroes was released, it was clear that most of Jimi's best compositions had already been released to the public.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The fat cats at the label had a field day as they learned about the Hendrix tapes. Unfortunately, Jimi's close friend Eddie Kramer had no interest in producing and releasing these recordings. Warner Brothers therefore contacted a New York producer called Alan Douglas. Douglas, a wiry hippy with a fake tan that once recorded an inconsequential Hendrix session, was entrusted to make something out of the reels of tape.

   Crash Landing was to highlight the direction that Hendrix was heading before he died. At least that's what the label's massive ad campaign tried to convey. In reality, this album documents the ambitions and warped decisions of Alan Douglas. In his twisted world, the original recordings were too raw and messy for release. He firmly believed he had the right to alter Jimi's work in order to make it palatable. In late 1974, he contorted and re-interpreted music recorded in 1968-1970 and made it "fit" into the mid-70s music market.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He was not alone in this endeavor. Engineer Tony Bongiovi (who at one point recorded Hendrix as a junior engineer) was instrumental in this process. Bongiovi and Douglas masterminded a strategy based on editing, splicing, deleting and overdubbing the Hendrix tapes. Yes, you heard right. These two cats summarily deleted Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding and Buddy Miles from the tapes. In their stead, listeners were treated to more "precise" and "correct" contributions from studio laureates like Bob Babbit (bass), Alan Schwartzberg (drums) and Jeff Mirinov (guitar). Yeah, they even overdubbed a guitar. On Jimi Hendrix songs. Unbelievable.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And yet, in my humble opinion, the final product isn't really all that bad. Really.

   See, the great thing about this album is that its aim and the execution coalesced extremely well. The idea behind this release was to show Hendrix's upcoming foray into funk. As such, the song choices and the overdub methods add up to a resoundingly listenable funk album. Though not without its flaws, I can honestly say that the first Alan Douglas album is kind of a cool little record.

   The album kicks off with a tune called "Message to Love." We'd heard it in Woodstock, and this studio version is quite focused and complete. The song was later released on The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set, as well as 1995's Voodoo Soup CD (also a Douglas creation). The version released in 1975 is quite similar to the box set version (i.e., the original mix). Why? Because Douglas opted to leave the original musicians on the recording. The mix makes the percussion stand out a bit more and the tune is a wee bit shorter, but overall, it experienced very few edits. Amazingly, the 1995 version features more remixing (half of the background vocals are inexplicably removed!) than the 1975 version. Overall, Douglas was unable to mess with such a good tune.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." Now things get interesting. The original recording is also on the box set, though its title is shortened to "Somewhere." The intro on the 1975 version has some echo and guitar overdubs that manage to breathe life into the limp original. Boasting a different mix and a greater level of energy, this version is a keeper. After the line "And UFOs chuckle themselves," the song gets a spacey guitar overdub that makes Jimi's comment sound more irreverent. A fine idea. That being said, I find it kind of funny that Douglas included this song, as it does contain some prophetic verses: "As far as I know, they might even try to wrap me up in cellophane and sell me..."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album's title track is a decent funk tune that boasts some bizarre female backing vocals: "Cut me free, cut me free!" Is this another instance of Jimi speaking from beyond the grave? Who knows. Kudos to Schwartzberg, for his funky drumming works quite well on here.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The A-side closes with a song titled "Come Down Hard on Me." This song had already been released as "Come Down Hard on Me Baby" on the European-only Loose Ends. In addition, it showed up as "Come Down Hard on Me" on the 2000 box set. The untampered version boasts some really funky drumming by Mitch Mitchell. Some folks have lambasted the 1975 version for being a "disco" song. Nay, I say. The 1970 original was clearly pointing at funk. The Douglas version is boosted by Allan Schwartzberg's hi-hat patterns. The beat lives on and takes on funky new dimensions. It's a very groovy song that shows us how Douglas didn't necessarily have to add too many modifications in order to "update" a Hendrix original.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The B-side is, in my opinion, the weaker half of this record. Why? Because the effortless thematic continuity of the first side has been replaced with an utterly hodgepodge selection of tracks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Peace in Mississippi" is a hard rock track that lurches forward at a slow pace and crushes everything that it encounters. It even features some swishy guitar overdubs that sound like Rodan or Mothra. Monstrously great. I reckon that makes the 1975 version just a wee bit cooler than original 1968 track recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Note: A longer and untampered version can be found on 1995's Voodoo Soup.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "With the Power" is a song that would've fit nicely on the A-side. It's as funky as anything you'll find there. Jimi's nicely wah-wah'd guitar work meshes well with Schwartzberg's drums. The vocals are soulful, and the chorus is great "With the power/Of Soul/Anything is possible." Quite memorable. Note: A longer and unadulterated version can be found on South Saturn Delta.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Stone Free Again" is based on a 1969 re-recording of a 1967 track. The arrangement and tempo was totally altered. The 1969 version is found on the box set. This 1975 Douglas version erases the Experience's contributions. Compared to the 1969 recording, this song lacks energy. The sessions musicians just don't cut it. In addition, it ruins Jimi's vocals. He sounds like he's recording his vocals in the nearby lavatory. A bit of a let down, actually.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album closes with "Captain Coconut." In the early 70s, one of Eddie Kramer's subordinates started splicing Jimi material together and came up with this song. He was reprimanded for these actions. Douglas, however, seized upon these tapes and continued the cannibalistic process. Originally labeled "M.L.K.", the edited track was henceforth known as "Captain Coconut." Why? Because no one in the studio could figure out what those three letters stood for. I bet none of them knew what Jimi Hendrix stood for either. Oh well. It's an okay track that functions as an atmospheric psychedelic coda to a pretty funky album. Note: Bits of this tune were used for "The New Rising Sun" on Voodoo Soup, while the entire 20-minute source jam was released as "Ezy Ryder/MLK (aka Captain Coconut)" on Burning Desire.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Overall, this album isn't really all too bad. No, it doesn't compared to the first three Jimi Hendrix Experience albums, or even the first two posthumous albums. But it is a funky little record that shows you just how magical proper edits can be. However, the success of this LP led to the release of another 1975 posthumous album, Midnight Lightning. Had the best two tracks off Midnight Lightning ("Trashman" and title track) been placed on this LP, Alan Douglas might've been hailed a hero. Or at least less of a cretin. Alas, he didn't. He went for the quick cash-in and even added his name onto the songwriting credits. This LP signals the beginning of a 20 year period in Hendrix history that involved sub-par and generally puzzling releases from the money-grubbing Alan Douglas. It all began here, too. It kinda sucks to know that this neat album is loaded with so many controversial actions.
