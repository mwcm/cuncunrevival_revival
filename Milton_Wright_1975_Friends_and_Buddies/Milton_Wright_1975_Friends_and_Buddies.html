   One of the most unique albums to ever come out of the Miami soul scene of the 70s – a sublime set of work that we’d easily rank right up there with the best material of the time from Donny Hathaway or Stevie Wonder! Milton Wright has a really jazzy groove to his music – and he mixes his own acoustic guitar lines with warm keyboards and unusual rhythms that often have a bit of synth or moog – never too much, and almost more of a Mizell-like touch, but a bit more understated overall!

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The cuts are wonderfully written – quite righteous, almost with a Terry Callier sort of sensitivity – and Milton‘s vocals more than have the chops to live up to the heady batch of artists we’re comparing him to in these notes. The sound is amazing throughout – one of those soul records that feels like nothing else you’ve ever heard, but which you can’t live without once you’ve heard it!

   Athens of the North is proud to present Milton Wright's stunning alternate version of the now Classic Miami soul LP 'Friends &amp; Buddies'. An altogether more stripped down, folky soul affair than its highly respected, much sampled brother is now available on Vinyl, CD and Digital for the very first time.

   Shelved at the last minute then re-recorded and overdubbed, only a few promo copies of this early version escaped from the studio and are deep in the collections of the very few previously in the know.

   The master tapes burnt in a fire at T.K Disco in Miami in the early 80s so even the label has not heard this in 30 Years. Many reissues of the second version of Friends &amp; Buddies LP have come and gone, but Milton's original vision has remained hidden until now.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As searingly honest and stunningly soulful as any seminal Marvin Gaye or Terry Callier LP, it stands tall amongst its exceptional peers as one of the true pillars of quality 70s soul.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Friends and Buddies is one of those albums every 70s soul fan has; if the original folk-funk version had been released in 1975 then you suspect it would be one of those albums most music fans either knew or had.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As Milton - now a retired judge in Boston - says: "If I had stuck with the first version of the album I might have been more successful." The issue of the first version is lot more Terry Callier than Stevie Wonder; stripped of keyboards its subtlety makes it more powerful and direct.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The release of original Friends and Buddies most likely won't put Milton Wright in the hall of fame, but if I were president then I'd announce a national holiday in celebration.

   "My music is the product of my Miami experience; the Caribbean and Latino influence; my midwestern sojourn; the Boston grooming and Gospel roots."
