   Hats off to Mick Ralphs for sharing a great Bad Co show with us. This has been LONG overdue!!! Sadly, the story i received is Paul did not not give his permission to release this set, and it was pulled from circulation and deleted from the Angel Air catalog. Anyway, enough of the legalities. This 2 disc set is a great showcase for the 'original' Bad Co. All the classics to date (March 76), are here: Good Lovin' Gone Bad, Can't Get Enough, Shooting Star, Run With the Pack, Feel Like Makin' Love, Rock Steady, Bad Company, and 9 more great tracks! This set is getting VERY hard to find now, and is a little pricey, but if you are a hardcore Bad Co fan, it is a MUST have! Excellent book with extensive liner notes, and a nice handful of great pic's courtesy of Mick himself. Thank's Mick for sharing this with us!

   Disc one opens with Live for Music which is a great opener and not on Merchants of Cool. Next, Good Lovin Gone Bad and Deal with the Preacher followed by two of my favorites Ready for Love and Wild Fire Woman. The next three songs Young Blood, Sweet Little Sister, and Simple Man also cannot be found on Merchants and disc one wraps up with Shooting Star and Seagull.

   Disc two opens with Run with the Pack followed by Feel Like Making Love and then the Kirke solo and Rock Steady. The second disc closed with Honey Child and slightly extended Can't Get Enough and Bad Company as the encore.

   In summary, this is an excellent snapshot of Bad Company at the top of their popularity and a disc I will treasure especially as it appears this will be a rare disc and hard to find. If you're a Bad Company fan and can get your hands on this then I recommend you do so.
