  Review by Lindsay Planer
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Chet Baker Quartet Featuring Russ Freeman (1998) is a perfect studio companion to the Mosaic Records set Complete Pacific Jazz Live Recordings of Chet Baker With Russ Freeman (1988). As was the custom for jazz platters of the time, both Baker and Freeman are joined by a different combo on each date. The luminaries include Bobby Whitlock (bass), Joe Mondragon (bass), Bobby White (bass), Larry Bunker (drums) and Shelly Manne (drums) from sessions held circa July and October of 1953. The 25 selections here provide copious evidence of Baker's uncanny artistry as he develops a dark, yet lyrical, interpretive approach. Immediately evident is the thoughtful synergy between Baker and the comparatively understated Freeman, whose comps help link the respective solos. In several notable instances, such as the nonchalant "Isn't It Romantic" or the limber syncopation of "Maid in Mexico," Freeman establishes the melody, rather than simply being relegated to the rhythm section. Additional diverse examples can be heard ranging from a sublime reading of "Imagination" to the upbeat and agile "All the Things You Are"â€” which commences in progress. These tunes would seed Baker's back catalog of material, becoming staples during his 30-plus-year repertoire. One facet to Chet Baker Quartet Featuring Russ Freeman that will be of considerable interest to collectors and hardcore enthusiasts are both the 10" EP and the 12" LP takes of "Long Ago and Far Away,""No Ties,""The Thrill Is Gone,""Moon Love" and the 78 rpm and long-player version(s) of "Winter Wonderland."While these renderings have been previously issued, this CD marks the first time that they are presented on a single volume. Among other stellar (if not definitive) inclusions are Freeman's "Russ Job,""Bea's Flat" and the sole Baker vocal on "I Fall in Love Too Easily."

   All of the tracks on this album were recorded in 1953 for Pacific Jazz and their subsidiary label World Pacific. On the first eleven tracks Baker is credited as the leader and on the remaining ones Russ Freeman is billed as a 'feature'. Listen to the sound samples on this page and you will Baker playing with more fire and aggressiveness than he later displayed after his style evolved and matured. I love his early work here and his later, more pensive work equally, so this album is a balance for me.

   Each instrument is perfectly placed. Each musician is exercising dynamic control, but whoever engineered this session did a remarkable job, and whoever mixed this release did an equally remarkable one to my ears.

   The first eleven tracks were recorded for Pacific Jazz under the auspices of the Chet Baker Quartet in a series of Los Angeles studio sessions in July 1953.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The very first track in the compilation was recorded on July 24, 1953 and features Baker backed by Russ Freeman on piano, Red Mitchell on bass and Bobby White on drums.

   Tracks 2 through 4 were recorded on July 27, 1953 with Bob Whitlock replacing Red Mitchell on bass.

   Baker and Freeman are backed by Carson Smith on bass and Larry Bunker on drums on tracks 5 through 11 that were recorded on July 29 and 30, 1953.

   The remaining tracks in this compilation were recorded at Radio Recorders in Los Angeles during a single October 3, 1953 session. This was recorded under the auspices of the Chet Baker Quartet Featuring Russ Freeman, and features Baker and Freeman once again backed by Carson Smith on bass and Larry Bunker on drums.

   The story in Holland is that when the Dutch police officer arrived at the death scene at the hotel in Amsterdam he inspected the body laying bloody and dead on the street. It was concluded that the body fell from the second story hotel window. In the room was found Heroin and Cocaine. In the body was found the same. No witnesses. The officer went home and sat in front of the TV with his dinner and a Chet Baker album on the record player. He was a huge fan of his work. He saw the news that Chet Baker was found dead on the street in Amsterdam. He was Heart Broken. Then he realized it was he that discovered the body but since Chet had destroyed himself with drugs he was not recognizable to even him. I don't know if that is true but it is safe to say Chet Baker chose a hard path in life. I think I hear it in some of his work. This is a good CD and if you are looking for a good jazz album with Chet singing on some tracks then this is a keeper. I have to be honest, there is some pain in his music that hooked me, but it is not all downbeat even though his life was.
