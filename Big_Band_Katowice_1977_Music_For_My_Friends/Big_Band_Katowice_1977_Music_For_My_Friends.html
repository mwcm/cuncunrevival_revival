   Katowice, the Capital of Upper Silesia - PolandÂ´s industrial region, was very important to the development of the Polish Jazz scene due to the fact that the local Music Academy was the first and for many years the only higher educational facility teaching a Jazz programme which awarded a degree in Music. The highly dedicated faculty and stuff directed generation after generation of young Polish musicians towards a career in Jazz music and in time the majority of the local Jazz scene was indeed a collection of the Katowice Music Academy alumni, the names of which are simply too numerous to mention. This phenomenon emphasizes the crucial importance of music education and its contribution to Culture. This album presents a Jazz Big Band led by trumpeter / composer Zbigniew Kalemba and comprising of the students of the Katowice Music Academy and guest soloists, some of which were ex-students, such as guitarist Jaroslaw Smietana, bassist Zbigniew Wegehaupt, pianist Wladyslaw Sendecki and many others. They perform eight compositions, five of which are originals and three standards, all beautifully arranged and passionately performed. The majority of the music has a distinct Jazz-Rock Fusion feel, which is not surprising as the genre ruled the local scene in the late 1970s. Since the Polish Jazz series includes only a handful of Big Band recordings, this is a most valuable addition to the overall presentation of the Polish Jazz scene. Warmly recommended!
