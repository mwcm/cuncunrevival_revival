  This quartet takes its roots in the Q65 group and released three albums in the middle of the 70's, all three in the typical "Dutch school". It's clear that these guys heard Focus and Solution or even Cargo, even if they were completely instrumental and generally harder-rocking than the afore-mentioned. Nevertheless their symphonic jazz-rock was at best enthralling (with exciting and virtuoso interplay) and at worst very cheesy, especially in the more symphonic bits. Founding member bassist Peter Vink (claiming his name's Emglish translation is Finch) and drummer Klaase provide the strongest of support for guitarist virtuoso Joop vanNimwegen and Paul Vink on keys. Upon the recording of their debut album in 75, Glory Of Inner Force, Determeyer replaced Vink on keyboards. Graced with a superb esoteric artwork and a title to go along with it, Finch's music was clearly influenced by Mahavishnu Orchestra (even the title could fit a MO album), Focus and Yes.
  <br/>
  Just three tracks on the debut album, starting very strongly with the bombastic Register Magister, where all four members go on to show the musical skills while remaining at the service of the music. The following Paradoxical Moods, where a haunting mellotron gives much depth to Joop's guitar antics and an awesome organ solo, courtesy of Determeyer. They really thrive on fast, odd time signature jams as well as slow moody sections and jump happily from one to the other without forcing it

  On the flipside, Pisces is another fine majestic piece (no pun intended), bur marred by the borrowing of a theme, reprised by the bass midway through the track until the end of it.The album closes on the brilliant Bridge To Alice, where the Yes influences seep out and impose itself as the album's highlight, even though it's not helped by being placed last in the track order. Indeed the formula of wall-to-wall solo plastering is exciting at first, but by the end of the album's one must admit that the cup is filled and one more solo would be the drop that overflowed the bucket. This is where the beauty of the vinyl (choose you side first) or the shuffle button become evident.

  The Cd reissue comes with two bonus tracks, the two sides of a non-album single from the same year. Both Colossus I and II are short tracks that are somewhat similar to the album's music, although it's plainly audible it's not the same sessions. One wonders why such a risk and expense were taken on (relatively) average instrumental tracks, as the ideas are good, but you don't have to be Nostradamus to see that they were not original enough to create an impact, especially for non-sung music. But both tracks fit well enough the album to enhance the album's content. If you must have only one Finch album (it sold relatively well, back then), make sure it's this one, as this one is as close to perfection as they ever got.
