   Walter Wanderley was a talented and gifted organist with an acute ear for new harmonies. With 46 recorded solo albums in his entire career, both in Brazil and the U.S., he reached number 26 on the Billboard pop charts in September 1966, opening a large pathway of success only menaced by himself and his complex character. Ten years after his death from cancer, with a new fad coming, he was repackaged by the entertainment industry as a mere lounge player, carrying his record sales even further and sending the cost of his out-of-print albums to the stratosphere, but all at the cost of minimizing his significance. It is forgotten that the time lag worked against him and what today is lounge music was then innovative and revolutionary. With all those fans of samba-canção divas feeling personally insulted by those percussive rhythms reminiscent of a Brazilian black tradition that was not dear to the average Brazilian, it has to be stressed that the bossa nova movement, and Wanderley within it, had the role of affirming Brazilian identity in a broader cultural industry which was developed out of the folkloric redoubts. In fact, he also has an upbeat production full of that energy provided by his distinctive staccato stuttering style, immediately reminiscent of authentic Brazilian rhythmic and percussive impetus. He also improvised extended melodic solos without reheated licks, but that was obviously also left out of his most popular albums.

   At five, he was already playing the piano. At 12, he attended the Licee of Arts for a year of theory classes, later studying harmony and arranging. Beginning his professional career while still in Recife, a most lively city with a vibrant cultural life, he worked every night either at the piano or at the organ. At 26, in 1958, he moved to São Paulo and immediately became an active player in nightclubs such as the Claridge, the Captain's Bar, and Oásis. Wanderley's first recording was in August 1959 for Odeon, with Carlos Lyra's "Lobo Bobo." Backing his wife, Brazilian singer Isaurinha Garcia (with whom he had a daughter, Monica), he recorded for the second time one month later. At that time, he was Garcia's accompanist and arranger. He would record another six LPs accompanying Garcia and another 19 solo albums in Brazil for several labels; he was left out of some of the credits because of his contract with Philips. Wanderley became known on the artistic scene for recording young artists, like Marcos Valle, Tom Jobim, João Donato, and others, until then with no expression out of the little nightclubs in which they performed on a nightly basis. But as the tunes and arrangements were fun to dance to, the albums sold very well. João Gilberto's João Gilberto (later reissued as O Mito in Brazil and as The Legendary João Gilberto in the U.S. in 1990 by World Pacific) from 1961 also had Walter in it. An impatient Wanderley then bent under Gilberto's oppressive, meticulous direction on March 10. That was the third album Gilberto was recording for Odeon and would be the last. Until then, Gilberto had Tom Jobim as pianist and Aluísio de Oliveira as producer. In spite of his frequent discussions with de Oliveira, the producer was the person who mediated Gilberto's hard relationship with Jobim. But de Oliveira had left Odeon the previous September, and Jobim didn't want to be scheduled for that recording. Gilberto, not knowing how to write music, insisted on expressing his musical vision of overall arrangements by singing, and that not only included the tones themselves, but the expression, timbre, and articulation. This drove Wanderley mad, especially with a certain sound effect of a boat's siren for "O Barquinho" ("Little Boat"), which was never good enough for Gilberto. The next day, Gilberto interrupted the recording of that album, only resuming it five months later with Jobim as musical director. Wanderley went on with his career and life, beginning an association with singer Claudette Soares in 1963, as an arranger and accompanist. His marriage was broken at this period. He also recorded for several renowned Brazilian singers in that time, among them Dóris Monteiro and Geraldo Vandré. It was when Tony Bennett saw Wanderley during a Brazilian tour and was taken by his playing. He urged Wanderley to move to the U.S. and, he himself talked about him to Verve Records producer Creed Taylor, also giving Taylor some of Wanderley's albums. After some insistence, Taylor sent contracts for Wanderley and his trio to record a single. So in 1966, they recorded brothers Marcos and Paulo Sérgio Valle's "Samba de Verão" ("Summer Samba"). It was an instant success, with radio stations playing it four or five times per hour. In that same year, the LP Rain Forest came out, also selling very well and was certified platinum (one million units sold) in two years. The trio accompanied Astrud Gilberto on her A Certain Smile, a Certain Sadness album, also in 1966. He would record six more solo LPs or singles for Verve until the next year, and ten more in his career in the U.S. He always sold well and had a full performing schedule, in which local presentations at the San Francisco area were interspersed with some tours to Mexico. He never did return to Brazil after moving to the U.S. and he went on with his life until death caught up with him.

   Wanderley's second album during Creed Taylor's A&amp;M residency opens with a bang, a fantastic rendition of the old Northern Brazilian standard "Asa Branca" that evokes the exhilaration of a street carnival. Midway through, the tempo kicks up, the band settles into a two-chord vamp, and the performance lifts into orbit; even the normally mild-mannered Wanderley dances wildly on organ and electric harpsichord. Nothing else here, even the provocatively titled "Proton, Electron, Neutron," approaches "Asa Branca"'s energy. Yet on the whole, this is a somewhat better album than its predecessor on A&amp;M; the sound is more open and less confined. The selection remains predominantly Brazilian, with an occasional American ringer like "Soulful Strut" and another Jimmy Webb tune, "5:30 Plane." The female voices (one of whom is Flora Purim) return on a few tracks; so do Hubert Laws and Romeo Penque on flutes. Eumir Deodato is in charge of the mauve-colored charts for flutes, trumpets and violas, and Airto Moreira makes an early impression pumping up the percussion section.

   The landing on the moon is the utmost important and boundary-breaking incident of the 21st century, hued in positivism, a landmark of technocracy. As such, it provides the truth that has always been radiated in Space-Age albums: technology is going to save us all, or what else to call the wonders of nogahyde, optimized seeds and perennial colors for one’s front porch. Not so surprisingly, Brazil’s premier organist Walter Wanderley (1932–1986) falls prey to the lure of the moon, the result being a superb amalgamation of Hammond organ vestibules, electric harpsichord fusillades, cherry violas, a smooth brass hydrazine as well as gleeful vocals. These entities become enmeshed in an aural propulsion called Moondreams.

   Recorded on three consecutive days in March 1969 and released in the same year on A&amp;M Records, it is a costly affair due to the huge amount of musicians and instruments involved in the studio. Wanderley is clearly and rightfully in the limelight and foreshadows the success of the big event that has yet to come, but his balmy organ droplets are skillfully underlined and at times even outshadowed by the talent of drummer Joao Palma, trumpeter Bernie Glow, the vocal allure of Flora Purim, Linda November, Stella Stevens and Susan Manchester as well as the whopping amount of eight viola players, five flutists, three bassists and a bag of surprises. How, then, is the organist able to plant the lush greenery of Rain Forest (1966) into space?

   The moon is close, the rocket is waiting, Walter Wanderley transforms the Samba-filled streets into an aeriform milky way on the opener Asa Branca. Originally composed by Humberto Teixeira and Luiz Gonzaga, the bandleader kicks off the spacy mélange with his raspy holiness, the electric harpsichord whose plinking laser pulses conflate with the car horn autochthony of the Hammond organ. Joao Palma’s sizzling hi-hats are cautiously accompanying the coruscating enigma. Euphonious and later greatly underlined by melodious chords, the standard eventually leads to Wanderley’s own L’Amore Dice Ciao, a mauve-tinted Space-Age ditty with mixed choirs, Bernie Glow’s flügelhorn sinews that evoke Brazilian melancholy and last but not least, polyrhythmic cannelures that range from 4/4 boosts to Waltz flares.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The bandleader continues the journey with another original: Penha is a laid-back Gothic beach scenery that shuttles between Baroque powder and sun-dappled chords from Rio, all the while Jimmy Webb’s One Of The Nicer Things vaporizes a gorgeous New Age-oid paradise of cauterized organ blebs and polylayered flute washes. With no care in the world and insouciance revved up to the max, side A closes with Wanderley’s stacked bleepfest Proton, Electron, Neutron whose calcined trumpet emissions are alloyed by twinkling organs and rounded off by a gurgling-hollow bongo beat.

   Jimmy Webb’s 5:30 Plane greets the listener on side B, making the traveler aware of the fact that orbit has to be reached yet again. However, said plane is poised to take off for sure as the English lyrics of the Space-Age choir intermix with the soothing loungerie of eight violas, lift muzak percussion and crisp harpsichord splinters. Mellifluous and auroral, the next stop comes soon enough in the shape of a saffron-colored Eugene Record‘s and Sonny Sanders’ Soulful Strut that evokes the Brazilian way of life as best it can. An uplifting moiré of iridescent organ vesicles and scintillating harpsichord helixes tumbles around trumpet protrusions, George Duvivier’s bubbly bass and several flute flumes par excellence.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Norman Petty’s title-lending gold standard Moondreams follows suit. Made popular by Budy Holly, Wanderley and his men turn things around by focusing on pre-Disco legato washes, glistening slivers and a transformed show tune physiognomy before George Benson’s and Will Downing‘s Jackie All comes into play. Functioning as sort of a an appendix, it keeps both the pace and textures and embeds the mellifluous brass layers in thickly wadded viola-based cushions of cotton candy. Ray Davies’ Mirror Of Love closes the album via luring English Space-Age lyrics, multiplexed organ cataracts and a decortication based on the Hammond organ. The harmony is once again ultra-catchy, making the closure of the album all the more painful. Hit repeat and fly away one more time!

   Walter Wanderley’s Space-Age opera is a stupendous trip that works so fantastically well due to its easygoing atmosphere. In lieu of multitudinous textures and extravagant riffs, it is the close encounters of the textures and their symmetry that make this album a feast for the senses. Both Wanderley’s electric harpsichord and organ are the ever-important devices of every arrangement. They remain in the limelight for obvious reasons, but it is still astonishing how effective the gyration tendency and titration process work to the album’s advantage. There seems to be a lactal veil spanned over the whole recording. Like a crimson reticulation it soothes the soul and alters the perception, but doesn’t degrade the high fidelity of the record, nor is it prone to limewash the luminescence.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Even the harpsichord, while clearly being the roughest and hardest-to-tame inclusion of Moondreams, still emits a certain magic timbre that is otherwise amiss in Henry Mancini’s over-the-top productions where it harms the balance; Music Of Hawaii (1996) and Symphonic Soul (1975) come to mind in particular. Not so on Wanderley’s album: the occasionally incongruent timbre ennobles the lactal listening experience and makes a galactic corker out of an album that is otherwise bound by gravity, as shown in the Samba-oriented material. It is even more disturbing that the album has not yet been reissued or remastered, so the vinyl version or rips thereof need to do it in the meantime.
