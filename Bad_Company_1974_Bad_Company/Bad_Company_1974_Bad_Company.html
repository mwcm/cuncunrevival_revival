   When Free disbanded in mid 1973 Paul Rodgers teamed up with Mick Ralphs, who had recently departed from Mott The Hoople, with a plan to make an album together. Rodgers had met Ralphs when Rodgers short lived project Peace had toured with Mott The Hoople during the first Free split in 1971/2 and the two had shown a mutual respect for each others work. Ralphs finally left Mott when they refused to record 'Can't Get Enough'. When Ralphs first played it to Rodgers the latter declared it a sure fire hit and said 'I'll sing that song'.

   Following the demise of Free, Simon Kirke had gone off an a lengthy holiday to Brazil and on his return contacted Rodgers to see what he was doing. Kirke knew Ralphs vaguely from his Mott days and accepted an invitation to go to Rodgers house and jam on some new material. Kirke was impressed and soon the duo were increased to a three piece. The final piece of the jigsaw however took a little longer to find. It has been suggested since that as many as sixteen different bass players were tried, John Wetton being the most noteworthy, before ex King Crimson man Boz Burrell secured the gig with his non prima donna attitude and natural playing style. Rumour has it he had been taught to play bass parrot fashion by Robert Fripp on a transatlantic flight during his time with Crimson. Alexis Korner once proclaimed him 'the most natural bass player I have ever heard'.

   Prior to the line up being finalised Rodgers had contacted Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant to see if he would manage them. Subsequently Grant signed the band to Zeppelins fledgling Swan Song label. Initially though, Grant was not keen on the Bad Company moniker but (as had done with Free, who Island wanted to call The Heavy Metal Kids) Rodgers stood his ground and insisted there would be no change. It has long been considered that the name derived from Rodgers love of the 1972 film of the same name starring Jeff Bridges but this remains unclear as Rodgers has since denied it.

   With line up, management, name and a great set of songs all ready in place Bad Company had a stroke of good fortune when Zeppelin were delayed by a couple of weeks when they were due to start work on the initial sessions for the Physical Graffiti album. Grant had a mobile studio all set up at Headley Grange sitting idle so suggested to Bad Company that they 'might get a couple of tracks down if they were quick'. With the enthusiasm of a new venture burning in their souls they were not satisfied with laying down a couple of tracks and they recorded the whole album plus a couple of B sides and an unused track in the two weeks.

   Bad Company's self titled debut album takes the old Free addage of 'less is more' but transfers it from the blues boom sound of the sixties to the stadium rock sound of the seventies but without losing any of the soul. The foundations of Bad Company can clearly be heard on the final Free album Heartbreaker but Ralphs adds the rock n roll riffing that was never a part of Kossoffs armoury and Burrell does what all good bass players do .... add a little funkiness now and again and keep things on an even keel the rest of the time.

   Bad Company the album is packed full of fine hard rocking bluesy tunes that have become a mainstay of American FM and latterly UK classic rock radio since it was released way back in June 1974. It features the obvious well known hits that really need no lengthy descriptions like the strutting love man pout 'Can't Get Enough', the laid back funky riffy groove that is 'Rock Steady', the heartfelt blues soul plea of 'Ready For Love', which had been recorded by Ralphs previous band Mott The Hoople on their 'All The Young Dudes' album albeit in a slightly different format and the moodily atmospheric title track for which Rodgers recorded his vocal in a field under a full November moon. Then there are the three lesser known slower tracks 'The Way I Choose' which has a definite Highway era Free vibe about it. 'Seagull', an acoustic track on which Rodgers plays all the instruments, which has latterly become something of a classic in its own right due to Rodgers featuring it very prominently in his solo shows and the recent reunion tours. 'Don't Let Me Down' is probably the closest the album has to filler and is at times alarmingly similar to the Beatles track of a similar title. However, the addition of Sue and Sunny on backing vocals and Mel Collins on sax give the track a certain soul sound that The Beatles could never have managed. Add to this the storming second single, another Ralphs classic 'Movin On' which tells the tale of life on the road and you have what surely must be a contender for the best debut album of its day.

   The record buying public of 1974 certainly agreed and the album peaked at #3 in the UK and #1 in the US subsequently providing Swan Song with a #1 album before Led Zeppelin themselves did. They also recieved a number of awards including best new group and best vocalist. At one point Bad Company was certified as the 46th best selling album of the seventies with over 5 million copies sold. Proof if it was needed that sometimes Bad Company is indeed good company.
