   In the Spring of 1966, ESP was given a grant by the New York State Council on the Arts, to tour the five colleges in the state with music departments. Artists for this tour included the Sun Ra Arkestra, Burton Greene, Patty Waters, Giuseppi Logan and Ran Blake. Accompanied by an all star backup group from among the participants, Patty's performances resulted in the album, "College Tour", her second recording for ESP-Disk'. The album expands upon the vocal acrobatics that were heard on her first recording, "Sings". "College Tour" won second place for Vocal Recording in Jazz and Pop Magazine in 1970.

   Patty Waters is internationally recognized as one of the first major avant-garde vocalists. Her ESP-Disk' recordings cemented her reputation as a vocal innovator, and according to liner notes and public opinion, one whose influence extended beyond jazz to Yoko Ono and Diamanda Galas.

   Just before Brian Jones mirrored Keef's ghostly otherworldly visions, before Pink Floyd had bulk loaded avant-garde deconstruction into their act, Patty Waters' stage routines cauterised both; screaming blue murder on 'Song of the One', her low-key support at times frightened to pick up any discernable tempo or hit bum notes, 'Hush Little Baby With Ba Ha Bad' her way of marking cursed ground with some whispering spook giving her directions as she staggers defiantly along. Clashing cymbals acting as medium for these spectres, plucked bass notes that sound even less crude than strangely times piano fills, Patty Waters sure as hell believes in total musical experience. There are one or three beings not of this world swirling around Waters, the fact she doesn't need any cues from this world to go into her personal space practically suggests this.
