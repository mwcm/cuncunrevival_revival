   Trust me when I include Max Sunyer's name along with the likes of Al DiMeola, Jorge Strunz, &amp; John McLaughlin. Here is a fusion guitarist from Spain, one the held that instruments position in the little known fusion band from Spain called Iceberg. Sunyer's solo cd Babel, really reminds me of the multi-national fusion ensemble Caldera, in that there are strong leanings towards a latin feel, using percussions, flutes, saxes, acoustical and electric guitars, synths as well as the type of chordal progressions that represent the very substance of this cultural music phenomina, and Sunyers' romantic, expressive style of playing, seems to evoke the very passion of his soul. He also tears into a similar frenetic pizzicato technique used by Al DiMeola and Jorge Strunz. The fact that Sunyer is an accomplished musician in no way deters from what his true admiration of fusion music is, and that is building themes from melody, and a solid musical backdrop with which the soloists are able to release their utmost passionate expressions via their instruments.

   This is most certainly a cd that is well worth tracking down if the artists mentioned are in the style of music you like, and I should mention the Iceberg cds are also excellent fusion, also present on this cd is Iceberg's fine keyboardist Josep Mas, who, like Sunyer, is able to play in the styles of the greats, Corea, Zawinul, Del Barrio, etc.

   This is vintage fusion, from 1978, and from an artist that was sadly overlooked in his day, but as many readers, prog/fusion heads already know, rediscovery of these retro gems of music are seldom disappointing, and those that long for the heyday of fusion's onset will really find this music very gratifying.
