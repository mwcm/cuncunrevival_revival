   The sound of an artist coming into his own, this is Fela's first great album (I'm not counting at Afro Beat on Stage: Recorded Live at the Afro Spot because it's live and a lot messier than this one, though as a snapshot of Fela's development it's even more essential than this one). For the most part he's swung totally from his highlife roots into full-on funk, but Afrobeat is finally starting to rear its head here. The most glaring sign of things to come is on "Egbe mi o" (featuring Ginger Baker!), where Fela delves into one of the spoken word interludes that would become a trademark while The Africa '70 grooves behind him.

   In 1971, Fela Anikulapo Kuti's record company (EMI) agreed to finance a recording date in London for Fela and band. Now huge stars in Nigeria, this trip was, in a way, a triumphant return to the country that had provided Fela with a musical education and the club scene where he cut his proverbial bandleader's teeth. What is important to note is that he had become good friends with former Cream (and at the time of this recording current Blind Faith) drummer Ginger Baker, who had traveled to Lagos a year earlier to meet, hang out, and play with Fela. Baker shows up on this recording (albeit uncredited) on the track "Egbe Mio," but more importantly helped get Fela gigs all over the city at such venerable venues as the 100 Club, the Cue Club, and the Four Aces. Recording at Abbey Road (a.k.a. the hallowed home of the Beatles) Fela cut these five awesome tracks in which his Afrobeat sound is more complex and jazzy than on the '69 Los Angeles Sessions. At over 13 minutes "J'ehin J'ehin" cuts a wicked groove for its entire length pushed by the horn section and Tony Allen's superlative drumming. "Buy Africa" is a anti-colonial rant worthy of the Last Poets, and "Fight to Finish" very simply kicks out the jams. A stunning record that marks the beginning of Fela's best period of recording.

   Nothing here has the complexity or immediacy of his later works, but that isn't to say Fela wasn't a master experimenter already: several of these pieces change horses mid-stream, and the results are never anything less than funky. The man's playing around with song structures and with the very notion of African pop (as well as funk) as a genre, and you can tell that he (and everyone around him) is having a lot of fun doing it. "J'ehin J'ehin" features some of Fela's best organ playing, and this band was known as his most swinging lineup. Even if this isn't as developed as what would come just a couple of years later that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it on its own merits, as this is just a really, really great funk record
