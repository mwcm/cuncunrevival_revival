   BAUHAUS is an impressive five-piece fusion set from the early 70s who never released an album until the live cd "Stairway to Escher" was pressed by Akarma in 2003. Three of their musicians (guitarist Luigi Calabrò, bassist Paolo Damiani and drummer Rino Sangiorgio) have been members of BUON VECCHIO CHARLIE. However, BAUHAUS is totally different, their material featuring instrumental jazz-rock heavily influenced by the likes of WEATHER REPORT and MILES DAVIS.

   "Stairway to Escher" is a live 'in-studio' recording done at Festa Garage Studios in Rome, in May 1974. The technical proficiency of these musicians is astounding and the production surprisingly good for a 30-year old treasure. The keyboards (particularly the electric piano), the saxophone, guitar, bass and drums all get into some serious blowing that will satisfy the most blasé jazz-rock fans.

   Born out of the ashes of Buon Vecchio Charlie, this Italian Jazz Rock combo was equal unlucky at its precursor, not having the chance to come up with a proper recording during its brief career.Three member of Buon Vecchio Charlie participate on Bauhaus, guitarist Luigi Calabro, bassist Paolo Damiani and drummer Rino Sangiorgio along with sax player Claudio Giusti and keyboardist Alberto Festa.Bauhaus performed at the Villa Pamphili festival in Rome in 1974, where they won the Best Italian Band prize and their only documents come from a live session at the Festa Garage Studios around the same time.However these recordings would only see the light some 30 years later as a posthumous album, released on Akarma under the title ''Stairway to Escher''.

   Buon Vecchio Charlie had their jazzy moments as well, but the new step on this early Italian Prog group's members was definitely in a much jazzier vein, extremely close to compatriots PERIGEO, who were quite succesful at the time, with loose arrangements, rich solos and a sense of freedom among their musical ideas.Slight WEATHER REPORT and RETURN TO FOREVER inspirations are also present throughout the listening.The seven pieces follow the vein of electric Jazz Rock with extended jamming parts and alternating climates, starting from mellow sax-based intros and ending in a fiery Jazz Rock attitude with pounding bass and drum parts, very sharp electric guitars and ethereal electric piano lines.Lots of inventive sax leads, some nice interplays and of course tons of individual jazzy solos are present as well.The tracks contain very dense instrumental music with little space for breathing and often an abstract, quirky style with constantly shifting performances.The result is pretty good with some of Calabro's guitar moves being absolutely fascinating, while Festa's dreamy electric piano is propably the main reason of the CHICK KOREA-related similarities.

   Akarma reissued the album in vinyl for die-hard fans of collectable issues and any fan of PERIGEO, dense electric Fusion and sax-fronted Jazz Rock should be a proud owner of this album.Warmly recommended.
