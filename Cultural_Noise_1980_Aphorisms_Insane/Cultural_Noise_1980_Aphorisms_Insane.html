  CULTURAL NOISE was an obscure Austrian trio which released one electronic Berlin School inspired album called 'Aphorisms Insane' containing two long suits of music which can be compared to TANGERINE DREAM of the earlier years. Later on they continued making electronic music and one more album under the monicker BIZARRE KO.KO.KO.

  Let's see, three guys who play a raft full of analog keyboards and one doubles on guitar. I bet they sound like Tangerine Dream! And indeed they do. The really good years of T Dream too, between 1974 and 1977. Lots of fat analog sequencers, fuzz tone guitar and quite a bit of twists and turns. Mellotron M400, Micro Moog, EMS Sequencer, Roland Sequencer, ARP Sequencer, ARP 2600, VCS 3, Roland Studiosystem 700. And two 20 minute tracks with names like 'After the Selfdisintegration in Time' and 'Pursuing the In Time Disintegrating Reality'. Who knows why a major label would sign someone up like this, but we're glad they did. Come to think of it, the modern UK group Redshift sounds more like Cultural Noise than Tangerine Dream. For fans of Berlin Electronic styled music, this is as good as it gets.
