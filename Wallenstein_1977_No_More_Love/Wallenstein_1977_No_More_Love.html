   Wallenstein 1977 ; classical Pianist Jurgen Dollase and Bassist Jurgen Pluta from the previous album's line-up have enlisted new members Gerd Klocker (Guitars) and Nicky Gebhard (Drums/Perc.) and dispensed with their Violinist altogether. So much for the 'Symphonic Rock Orchestra' vision lasting for too long.... The band have now signed to a major, RCA (Germany), and obviously it's within their walls where Dollase signed along the dotted line and commercial considerations were taken into account. Actually, the new music does have moments of the once decent band they were, amidst the instrumental passages of the longer cuts. But the vocals here let the whole package down. All said, 'No More Love' displays a rather 'fresher' sound than previously, with Dollase adding the sounds of Clavinets and more synthesizers, alongside his ever-present Piano, and all members contributing the aforementioned vocals (lots of 'massed' voices to be heard, especially on the choruses). As more often than not, the famous studio wizzard Dieter Dierks handles the production. Dierks has mostly dealt with the 'heavier' sounding Euro-Prog acts of the day (Omega, Jane, Nektar, to name just 3) and his main success to this point has been working with 'The Scorpions', and he seems to have mastered how to give a final product an accessible, radio-ready sheen, whilst maintaining a band's subtle and dramatic Progressive tendencies. This is both a good and bad thing, I guess, depends on who he's producing. The 6 tracks on the album vary considerably in quality, from commercial - the opening song 'Seventy-Seven' is an anthemic little ditty that serves as a possible hit, but ends up missing the mark, and the throwaway track 'Jo-Jo' (eek !!) won't do much to alter their popular status either. 'I Can't Loose' is a song that falls somewhere in the middle - too 'safe', too pleasant. The more faithful Prog-Rock workouts (admittedly, with emphasis on the 'Rock' part) are the tracks 'Backstreet Dreamer', which features a superb introduction, rocking verses, and an interesting middle section showing off processed guitar sounds and glistening keyboards, driven along with an energetic rhythm section. The longest piece 'No More Love' (8.27) is centered around Dollase's excellent Keyboarding, and is a mid-paced affair with many changes that flow seamlessly together. There is a mighty section where Dollase plays an extended synth solo backed with some Latin percussion. A fine composition for sure, and up there with their best. Lastly, 'On An Eagles Wing' is easily as good, bursting at the seams with a powerful Clavinet and searing Guitar duel, Dollase and Klocker against each other in a final bid to win whatever stakes their lives depended upon......but who knows, Dollase sacked the lot of them after this album.
