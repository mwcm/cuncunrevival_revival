   Albums by sidemen typically aren't very good - after all that's why most of them are relegated to sidemen status.   There are occasional exceptions to the rule - one of them being this 1974 set by keyboardist John "Rabbit" Bundrick.

   Using his nickname "Rabbit", 1974's "Dark Saloon" was self-produced and featured all original material.  No matter what you thought about the album, that certainly reflected some faith on the part of Chris Blackwell's Island Records. Allowing a new artist to self-produce and showcase original material was a rarity.  Hell, a lot of times established acts were not given those privileges.  The album found Bundrick working with at least three, or four different line-ups. The title track and 'Special Woman' were recorded with guitarist Janne Schaffer and other Swedish musicians he met while working on the soundtrack to the Johnny Nash starring film "Vill så gärna tro" (translated as Want So Much To Believe"). Tracks like 'Dig' and 'Cheat On Me' found him collaborating with what was to become the core of Back Street Crawler/Crawler.  Elsewhere a couple of tunes appeared to have come out of a collaboration with Stray Dog members Al Roberts and Snuffy Walden.  Reflecting the different collaborators, the album had an extremely varied sound including stabs at everything from conventional rock ('Don't You Leave Me Babe')  to horn- powered funk ('Devil Run'), and even reggae '('43 Revolution').   I won't try to make the argument this was a classic album, but I'll tell you that on a song-for-song basis it was better than some of the material issued by band Bundrick supported as a keyboard player.
