   With backing from Alexis Korner, the father of the famed British blues movement, Free came together in April of 1968. The birth of the British blues-rock boom produced such legendary acts as Led Zeppelin, The Jeff Beck Group, Cream, The Faces and Humble Pie, as well as Free, which included vocalist Paul Rodgers, guitarist Paul Kossoff, bassist Andy Fraser and drummer Simon Kirke.

   When Free hit the scene, the group made an immediate impact. Depsite a relatively short run of just less than five years together, Free moved at a fast pace, always pushing forward, willing to experiment with a less-is-more stance. In addition, Free were a touring machine and the quartet was often featured on the BBC, where the young band was always anxious to showcase new material.

   While a good portion of Free's BBC recordings have been lost over time, Live at the BBC features two CD's worth of material that has survived to this day. In some instances "off air" material has been included which lacks the sound quality of the master tapes, but still captures the raw spirit and vibe of the energetic Free.

   Disc one from the compilation features songs from Free's BBC sessions, which the group first undertook in July of 1968, just three months after forming, when they recorded four songs for Top Gear. The only song remaining from the group's initial venture on the BBC is "Waiting on You", which appropriately opens disc one of the collection. "Sugar for Mr. Morrison" follows, which was recorded during Free's second BBC session, from November of 1968. Over the course of the next few years, Free continued to entertain radio listeners during their numerous BBC appearances, with takes of such noteworthy numbers as "I'm a Mover", "I'll Be Creepin'", "Woman", "Fire and Water", "Ride on a Pony" and the group's signature track "All Right Now", represented on the Live at the BBC anthology.

   Disc two from the BBC set features eleven songs culled from a pair of John Peel Sunday Concert performances. The first four tracks, "The Hunter", "Woman", "Free Me", and "Remember", were originally simulcast on January 1, 1970. Depsite the fact that the songs suffer from bootleg sound quality, the fact that the cuts have been salvaged and included with the extensive collection is noteworthy. The group's performance from July 2, 1970, is a marked improvement in sound, as Free deliver the goods in spades with "Fire and Water", "Be My Friend", "Ride on a Pony", "Mr. Big", "Don't Say You Love Me", "Woman", and an inspired version of "All Right Now".

   By February of 1973 Free called it a day following a tour of the states with Traffic. During their run, Free managed to record six studio LP's, plus a live album, tour virtually non-stop and entertain their fan base with numerous appearances on the BBC. The group was a reflection of the blues based rock that they performed and their revered status was based on the band's hard work ethic.
