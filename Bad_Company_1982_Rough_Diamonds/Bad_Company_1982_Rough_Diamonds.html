   Despite the success of 'Desolation Angels' the individual members of Bad Company were becoming a little disillusioned and jaded with the rock n roll lifestyle so the decision was taken not to record an immediate follow up on completion of the 'Desolation Angels' tour. Rodgers in particular had not reacted well to the death of John Lennon and creative juices were not exactly flowing. Add to this the death of labelmate and friend John Bonham and the unenthusiasm of a largely absent Peter Grant and you have a pretty unsettled ship that is not exactly conducive to making good music. To make matters worse individual relationships within the band were disintegrating most notably between Rodgers and Burrell.

   Despite all this Bad Company reconvened at Ridge Farm in Dorking during late 1981 individually armed with demos and song ideas. This probably explains the reason why every track on the album bar one is an individual composition and the album as a whole has a very bitty and 'contractual obligation' feel about it. Its pretty clear that this is a bunch of musicians who really do not want to be there and although there are some decent moments, proving that class will always outdo form in all areas of life, it is still a huge drop from 'Desolation Angels'. In fact if this had turned out to be out takes or rejected tracks from the previous albums sessions it wouldn't have surprised me in the slightest.

   Opening track 'Electricland' is clearly the class act on here and was included live for the first time ever on the recent reunion tour. It is classic Bad Company with a great vocal and and a superb driving rhythm. 'Untie The Knot', the only co-write on the album (Rodgers/Kirke), is a quirky little track and is often regarded as one of the better tracks on the album but I have never really taken to it and it always sounds a little forced to me. 'Nuthin On The TV' is one of three songs on the album, the other two being 'Cross Country Boy and 'Ballad of the Band', that are basically little more than poor B-sides. to call them filler is generous in the extreme. They wouldn't have come within in a country mile, cross or otherwise, of getting onto any of the previous Bad Company albums and are to be brutally frank, embarrassingly poor.

   It is also worth noting here that the enthusiasm from Mick Ralphs must have been particularly lacking as Paul Rodgers actually provides the lead guitar for three of the tracks, the aformentioned 'Cross Country Boy', 'Downhill Ryder' and 'Painted Face'. That, to me at least, speaks volumes about the commitment levels here. It is not surprising that in places and particularly on those three tracks 'Rough Diamonds' is closer in sound to Paul Rodgers subsequent solo album 'Cut Loose' than any of the previous Bad Company albums.

   'Painted Face' itself is not a bad song, it just doesn't sound like Bad Company. Similar could be said of 'Downhill Ryder' which has a nice funky feel to it and along with 'Electricland' they are my personal favourites. Of the other tracks 'Old Mexico' and 'Kickdown' are typical Mick Ralphs country tinged western flavoured stories but lack the conviction of his better compositions and 'Racetrack' has a catchy infectious melody but little else to recommend it.

   Unsurprisingly they decided not to tour to promote the album and subsequently 'Rough Diamonds' became the original line ups worst selling album. Curiously enough it still fared better than all of the future Bad Company albums on which Paul Rodgers didn't feature and still managed to hit the Top 30 on the album chart. Although no official announcement was made the release of the Paul Rodgers solo album 'Cut Loose' in 1983 signalled the end of the original Bad Company. Rodgers then went on to form The Firm with Jimmy Page after which Kirke, Ralphs and Burrell took the unlikely decision to reform without him. A glaring omission to say the least. Unsurprisingly the Rodgers free Bad Company never came close to emulating the success of the original line up. Although to be fair to them they did put out some fairly decent albums even if they sounded more like Foreigner than Bad Company. It was only during the Robert Hart years that they started to sound like Bad Company again but that is for a different a review.
