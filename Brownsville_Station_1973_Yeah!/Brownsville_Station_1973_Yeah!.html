  Hailing from Ann Arbor, Brownsville Station’s third album lives up to its name with ten great songs. Eight covers, all given the treatment, and two originals — one of which sold two million copies. “Yeah!” is the quintessential “nice little record” — it won’t take up a lot of your time, and it’s got a very friendly vibe to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cover songs span a wide variety of musical styles. From Hoyt Axton’s “Lightning Bar Blues” to then-unknown Jimmy Cliff’s “Let Your Yeah Be Yeah” to Lou Reed’s “Sweet Jane,” the band pumps out all of its songs in a chugging, lighthearted manner that ends up being nothing but fun.

  <br/>
  Lead vocals were previously the exclusive domain of bassist Michael Lutz, but Koda emerges as a singer as well; Lutz may have been the more prototypical rock singer, but it was Koda’s sleazy, nasal snarl that worked to perfection on the classic hit single “Smokin’ In the Boys Room.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Yeah!” is truly delightful
