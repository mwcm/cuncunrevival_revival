  Track B5 is actually by Jasmin-T

  NOTE - there are 2 versions of this release and it is extremely important to know this, as the re-issue is extremely common and easy to find. Whereas the geniune original 1st Pressing is very rare indeed:-
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Original 1st Pressing - 3 colour label + most importantly (and logically!) the De Wolfe label logo matches the DeWolfe logo on the cover! This label was available from the day this LP was first issued right through to the end of 1969.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) Later 1970s re-issue with orange labels and the later 'DW' label logo. These are very common as re-issues on this label, as they were available for 6 years between 1970 and 1976. DeWolfe also never changed the cover, so these common re-issues are easy to spot as the re-issue 'DW' label logo is completely different to the one on the cover!

   Glimpses of what a virtual ’69 Pretty Things album may have sounded like resides on “Even More Electric Banana” in the form of five excellent tracks that are all unvarnished, live-run-throughs-in-the-studio that lacked Norman Smith’s “S.F. Sorrow” ornamentations. Many of these tracks evolved during the summer of 1968 in-between takes during the shooting of “What’s Good For The Goose” a light comedy which featured segments of them miming in the discothèque scenes. Although the same-named main title of the film (plus the sole un-Pretties instrumental, “The Dark Theme”) were the weakest links of the album, the remainder of the material is driving, robust Rock refracted through a hardened psychedelic lens.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The highlights of the set are oddly enough, the two places where Waller and not May sing lead: “Alexander” and “Eagle’s Son.” Taking place of pride as the album’s most finished, full-sounding and full-on occupants, the flammable lead fuzz guitar of Dick Taylor that merges into the organ to create a snarling combination begs comparison to his razing work on “S.F. Sorrow” (“Balloon Burning” and “Old Man Going” spring immediately to mind) as well as the parts he would contribute to the first Hawkwind album and perhaps even a seed of The Pink Fairies that Twink spirited off to plant in his solo album, “Think Pink.” Any which way you look at it, Taylor’s ever-underestimated guitar work burns down all over the place here, and the overall band chemistry walks a swift and hard tightrope straight down the line.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Alexander” cracks open the album with a brief syncopated pandemonium of drums and with the entry of weirdly piercing organ trills falling into crosstalk with the soaring rhythm guitar during the verses that recount glimpses of love, promise and death with mythical proportions. Wally Waller handles the vocals here with greatly staggered, halting cadence:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Poet dies stabbed with the knife of words...”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Young girl marries with bouquet of letters...”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “One life explodes and slides into the sea...”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And all the while, the three-part harmony chorus rings out over the din and across the entire Mediterranean:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “You...Loving me...Like a fire god...”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As all the while, he keeps pumping the bass pumped up and driving as the drums hammer, mean cymbals crash as the whole piece constantly revolves and swirls from side to side. One of the best tracks from their psychedelic period, “Alexander” showed the post-psychedelic Pretty Things not only gaining ground into harder edged Rock territory, but also mastering it. How I wish they’d recorded an album in 1969: it would’ve been heavy as Hel, I know it. 3

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “It’ll Never Be Me” takes a roughed up and simplified riff off “She Says Good Morning” and customises it with May sneering a mockery over the track’s broken crockery like Johns Lydon and Lennon while donning Ozzy’s tragic chorus mask bawl to soar throughout the harmony vocal sections. This mid-tempo stomp is rough and loose, and you can hear someone either giving the cue, delivering a half-assed response to May’s call or just taking the piss out of it all. The mood immediately drops into the raging and aching heaviness with attached lead weights of “Eagle’s Son.” Dick Taylor’s lead guitar features wildly here, exploding with unforgiving electricity, sensitive to the rhythm and responsive all at once with deft tone control and a highly focussed rhythmic sense as it punctuates every other line of the requiem with ferociously sustained fuzz/wah-wah counterpoint to claw and rend the sky like the gaping maw of death:

   (And the compressed guitar solo wedged in the middle is one of the finest and most intense Taylor ever did play. That and the mental free form meltdown on “Old Man Going.”)

   Continuing the pace with razor-edged and sinewy fuzz guitar, “Blow Your Mind” is more a blasting rave up with a brief tune tacked to its helm than a song with an instrumental tail out. The return of that searing organ/ fuzz guitar combo gains ground to fires up the track to more wild paces until it spins out of control and becomes unbearable to surmount any further and falls off. ‘Up tempo-freaky’ reads the next track description. And with a dead-giveaway title like “Rave Up”, little wonder it sounds every inch the set-ending bash up it most certainly was in live performance. Some frothing Dick Taylor guitar soloing, that careening high-pitched organ, May punctuating the mounting anarchic mess with “Yeah!,” “All right now, yeah!” and other such worthy one-liners that signal it’s time to just go for broke completely. Which they do -- and did do two months after the first Isle of Wight Festival during their performance at the Actuel Festival held in Amougies, Belgium. A brief portion was used in the film “Music Power” and caught them under very similar freak-out circumstances, a possible outro jam of their encore of The Byrds’ “Why.” May’s vocal mantra is the phrase “I See Fuzz,” John Povey walks barefoot and precarious towards the unmanned drum kit as Twink is already freaking out the audience with mime, a menacingly raised floor tom and blown kisses...

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It may very well have been the last, if not one of the last live performances of the group in this incarnation, as Dick Taylor bowed out of the band by late ‘69 for a short stint as producer, quickly replaced by Edgar Broughton Band guitarist Victor Unitt. Twink also took his leave at this time to fly with The Pink Fairies, with Skip Alan returning back to the fold on drums. The Pretties were now shunted off from Columbia by EMI to its newly-formed progressive offshoot label, Harvest where they would remain for only one album and a clutch of singles before temporarily heading into a half year’s sabbatical. Only Phil May would remain the sole original member as the group carried onward throughout the better part of the seventies before winding down. Sporadic activity continuing throughout the eighties, but major reactivation in the late nineties has since seen them treading the boards far and wide, performing one of the earliest live broadcasts via the internet, overseeing the re-release of their impressive back catalogue and generally unwilling to never say never or let sleeping dogs lie while turning on yet another generation of snotsters to be in the process. Bravo, gentlemen of endurance, may you keep bringing on the “big sound” for many, many years to come.

   1969’s ‘Even More Electric Banana’ was the first to have all its tracks recorded for a specific project, in this case the movie ‘What’s Good For The Goose.’ The group now consisted of May, Waller and Taylor, with Povey moving to Hammond organ and John ‘Twink’ Adler contributing drums, giving the recordings a fuller, heavier, more psychedelic sound. The album opener ‘Alexander’ features Waller on vocals and keyboards and is a psychedelic monster, with Waller’s efforts joining Taylor’s killer lead guitar and Twink’s drum groove. ‘It’ll Never Be Me’ has more tasty guitar from Taylor and would’ve fit nicely on The Pretty Things’ classic album ‘S.F. Sorrow.’ The highlight of the LP is ‘Eagles Son’ a moody psychedelic piece with Waller on vocals and Taylor’s guitar roaring. ‘Blow Your Mind’ the album’s longest cut at three minutes and forty seconds continues the ‘S.F. Sorrow’ feel with Taylor’s guitar soaring, yielding a heavy psych sound joined by Povey’s keyboards. All six tracks on ‘Even More Electric Banana’ are originals and it is considered by many as the group’s finest work. The movie title track is a light hearted number and may have been an attempt at a commercial hit with its gorgeous vocals and pop-influenced hook. ‘Rave Up’ is a short, two minute fuzz filled rocker with a driving beat. All the tracks besides ‘What’s Good For The Goose’ and ‘Rave Up’ are presented in instrumental versions, the former being balladish not suited for such release and the latter being nearly instrumental already. Disc two closes with ‘Hot Licks’ released in 1973 after a four year break and was recorded by May and Povey joined by drummer Skip Alan, guitarist Gordon Edwards, guitarist/keyboardist Pete Tolson and bassist Stuart Brooks. The new members brought a new sound, with the psychedelic recordings of the 1960’s giving way to hard rock while maintaining their R &amp; B roots and vocal harmonies. The album opener ‘Sweet Orphan Lady’ is a four and a half minute tune written by Tolson, Povey and May. The tune features a building beat and tasty lead line as well as a hot guitar solo and is reminiscent of Free’s ‘All Right Now.’. Tolson and May’s ‘I Could Not Believe My Eyes’ spotlights vocal harmonies on the R &amp; B tinged hard rocker. Another highlight is the Tolson, Povey and May penned ‘The Loser’ with guitars to the fore. Povey’s ‘Walk Away’ is a moody harpsichord and heavy guitar tune whose driving beat and vocal harmonies make it stand up to The Pretty Things at their best. ‘Good Times’ mixes keyboards and guitar with rich vocal harmonies bringing to mind Foreigner’s ‘Hot Blooded.’ Phil May’s ‘Easily Done’ side one’s closer is a hard rocker mixing guitar, piano and vocal harmonies making for a most pleasant ending to the side. The six tracks are presented in instrumental versions to close out the disc.
