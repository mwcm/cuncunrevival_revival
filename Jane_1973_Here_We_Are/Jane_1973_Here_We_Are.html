   After their excellent first album TOGETHER, JANE came back one year later with HERE WE ARE! This album follows the same pattern than the first one by mixing space rock, psychedelism with hard rock guitar bravado. A new bassist WOLFGANG KRANTZ took over CHARLY MAUCHER and plays guitar as well.

   The album starts strongly with quite a unique tune REDSKIN , a 8mns extravagant odyssey of groovy beats accompanying a psychedelic guitar solo before some spoken words appear with nice organ texture...and female vocals sounding like indian chants (yes the title of the song is REDSKIN, i told you!). At least this is a very different track that i cannot compare to anything else. You may like it or you may not; that's not here to leave you indifferent for sure.

   OUT IN THE RAIN is pure JANE at its best: a wonderful melodic ballad well sung with a beautiful mellotron soundscape and of course another emotional guitar solo just playing the right notes, but the ones which will touch you deep inside if you are into melody.DANDELION and MOVING follow in the same style, slow paced with a lot of organ and more beautiful guitar sounds. KLAUS HESS guitar technic is not about playing 20000 notes a minute, this is about making his guitar cry and transport deep emotions from his playing to your inner self making you feel good. A guitar with a heart so to speak!!

   WATERFALL is another mid-tempo spacey track with again beautiful guitar, angelic mellotron and....those delicate female vocals! Oh my gosh!! such a beauty! and this wonderful symphonic ending is sure to bring you to heaven prog!

   LIKE A QUEEN is another dreamy symphonic piece, albeit short but showcasing perfectly the JANE spirit and how good they can be at producing the best romantic melodic prog you will ever hear, sometimes reminding me of NOVALIS. HERE WE ARE the title track is more on the rock side with strong guitar riffs, but not that hard, don't worry!This song was the single of the album (the fanous 45 rpm of the time). An excellent opportunity for KLAUS HESS to show us how he can carry a song with a long powerful guitar solo getting more and more furious towards the end, but still played so tastefully!

   HERE WE ARE is the perfect complement to TOGETHER. My edition includes 4 bonus tracks, the single versions OF DAYTIME nad HANGMAN from the first album and HERE WE ARE plus REDSKIN from this album. Nothing to hurt you!!
