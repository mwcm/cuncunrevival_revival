   "Victims Of Tradition" is the second album from this early 70s Christian psych rock group. Agape was from California and preaching the gospel using a psych rock format and musically it's pretty good. Fred Caban wrote the lyrics, music and supplies the vocals on all the tracks. Fred was a young guitarist from Azusa, CA, who became a born-again Christian shortly after graduating from high school in 1968.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In an effort to help evangelize his peers, Caban formed the band with bassist John Peckhart and drummer Mike Jungkman. They were one of the earliest Christian rock bands, established in a time when the music they played was still being shunned by established churches (the few they approached for concerts rejected the loud music they played, despite the message).

   Agape performed wherever they could, on beaches, in schools, and in parks, and released their debut album "Gospel Hard Rock" in 1971.

   The band added keyboardist Jim Hess and released "Victims of Tradition" in 1972, which featured a more progressive approach, as well as a front cover that pictured the group performing in a graveyard.

   Their second album is more laid back than the first but both are equally sought- after.

   Agape’s second album is a  very different but equally good work.  Victims Of Tradition has a more complex song structure than the detub –  more of a progressive feel with keyboards (courtessy of Jim Hess) playing a bigger role, even delving into jazz fusion on ‘Jazz Jam (Part 1)’ and ‘You Reap What You Sow’.  As far as heaviness goes though, the album still hits just as hard.  ‘Wouldn’t It Be A Drag’ is my favorite here: a lengthly seven-minute outing that includes a two-minute drum solo, as well as solos for bass (from newcomer Richard Greenburg), guitar and electric piano before culminating in cacophonous bursts of noise. ‘The King Is Christ’ is a beautiful predominately acoustic piece – it almost sounds like the guitar solo was recorded backwards.  ‘Change Of Heart’ keeps that heavy Hendriux blues-rock sound alive.  As with Gospel Hard Rock, this is lyrically very evangelistic.  Not just God-loves-you sloagans – these guys present the gospel.  Much rarer than their debut and thus selling for mucho dinero these days.  Classic b&amp;w cover photo of the band playing their instruments in a graveyard.  Not many lps around that sound this unique, creative and on fire.  Classic rock indeed.  Re-issued on CD in 1996 with the bonus track ‘Oasis’.
