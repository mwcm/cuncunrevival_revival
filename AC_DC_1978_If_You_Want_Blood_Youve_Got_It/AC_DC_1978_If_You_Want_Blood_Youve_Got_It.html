   The long awaited AC/DC live album, and it doesn’t disappoint. Recorded on the Powerage tour, it contains material from the best that the lads had concocted to that point in time.

   This was a long way before my time of being able to attend concerts, and as such it is terrific to hear just how good the band was in those days in a live setting. It comes as no surprise, because they had cut their teeth on live performances long before they made their way onto studio recordings, but the legendary AC/DC rhythm section proves here that it has always been this good. Live albums from the 1970's often included long winded freeform guitar or drum or keyboard solos, which to be honest can be extremely boring on these kind of albums. Nothing like that here from AC/DC, who deliver exactly what you want and the way you want it. The one extravagance is Angus playing up to the crowd during "Bad Boy Boogie".

   Hearing all of these songs live just proves the greatness of this band. The rhythm section of the band is so tight that it sounds as though it could have been taken straight off the studio versions of each song. Add in the crispness of Angus Young’s lead guitar work and the dominance of Bon Scott’s vocals, and you have an extremely impressive live album.

   Could I have come up with a better set list? Quite possibly, but you can't knock what you find here. Bon is terrific on the opening squadron of "Riff Raff" and "Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be". The great songs of the era can be found here too, such as "The Jack", "Whole Lotta Rosie", "High Voltage" and "Let There Be Rock".

   It is great to have a solid live album with Bon Scott on vocals. While I prefer the later release of Live From the Atlantic Studios this is still a great album.
