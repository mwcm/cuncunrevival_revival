   ‘Espirito du Tempo’ or ‘Spirit of the Times’, is the third release from Brazilian percussion extraordinaire Dom Um Romao. Sometimes cited as Brazils ‘finest percussionist’, Romoa performed, collaborated and recorded with such greats as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Donato, Herbie Mann, Sergio Mendes and even Frank Sinatra. However he is more commonly renowned for being one of the founding members of the Jazz Fusion superband ‘Weather Report’, which at the time boasted the ‘cream of the crop’ of The US and South American Jazz players.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   According to several sources, he was a purist and aimed to show, especially on this recording, the true spirit of Afro-Brazilian music.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So it says, so eloquently on the liner notes, “I have the Afro-Brazilian authenticity in my music, because I come from the black people there; my background is from Africa”.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This album was recorded over two sessions in 1973 and was produced by Dom Um Romao with Joe Fields.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The ‘Spirit’ of Romaos history certainly shines through in the more traditional sounding tracks ‘Ginga Gingou’ and the closing track ‘Cosinha’, which are perfect example of the percussionist at work. Fast paced and super tight with all manner of drums being celebrated in a hypnotic samba rhythm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The meat of the record is made up of some amazing Jazz fusion style performances featuring flute and saxophone solos and some incredible keyboard playing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Apart from the traditional opener and closing tracks, ‘Lamento Negro’ stood out as being quite a superb arrangement that outshines the rest In my opinion. With it’s haunting choral lines and intense build ups.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Dom Um Romao is one gifted musician and I think any or all of his work would be appreciated by music fans.
