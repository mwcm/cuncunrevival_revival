   Between 1979 and 1984, Deviant (b. Stuart Powell, Enfield, England; vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Jellyfish (b. Kevin Nicholson, Tottenham, London, England; bass, vocals, keyboards) were the mainstay of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal band Tooth. After playing in various other groups, the two reunited in 1989 for a jam session with various friends and session men. Within a year they had assembled a stable line-up with ex-Swamp Angels guitarist Dave Williams and former lighting engineer Pete Smith. After a few gigs and two demos they found ex-Neil Christian bass player Arthur Anderson to record/produce and mix an entire album in 24 hours. The resulting So Join Mr Dreams offered a marriage of Doors, Motörhead and Hawkwind influences. It found little favour in the UK but an audience emerged in Europe. Dejected after a tour of Holland fell through at the last moment in 1992, they entered the studio to record a new album with producer Brian Martin. The resultant Lords So Strange R was a much more ambitious project, featuring the debut of female backing vocalist Jazz J. Soon afterwards they broke up, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Absent from the music scene, they attracted a cult following in Spain and Germany, as well as in ‘underground’ magazines around the world. The group re-formed late in 1994 minus Jazz J and Smith, and after initial studio work, were joined by session drummer ‘Chops’.

    But we had so many influences it was difficult to decide what to do, but me and kev decided to do the lot, from acid house dance with a.a.harvey from tonka sound (and the use of mood enhancing back masking) to punk, metal, ballads and dave's protest song.

    So we found a producer who worked with Jimmy Page and went into the studio for a 24 hour non stop session loaded with booze, drugs and shit loads of ideas.

   I absolutely love this album... I got it back when it came out because Renee owner of Any Record in Th Hague shoved it into my face one afternoon and told me I would love it, and to buy it, if I didn't like it I could return it next visit... I loved it and kept it! 20 Years later I lost my complete LP collection (Or actually the brother of a friend robbed me) and one of the albums that I regreed most losing was this one... I searched for it for years to no avail until a couple of days ago a friend I had made a cassette copy of it back in the 90's sent me this copy.
