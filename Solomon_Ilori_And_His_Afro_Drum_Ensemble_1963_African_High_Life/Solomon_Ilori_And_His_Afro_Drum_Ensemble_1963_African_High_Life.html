   The Nigerian-born Ilori arrived in the US in the late '50s and recorded the first six tracks on this album—the original African High Life release—in 1963. They're pleasant, if unspectacular, palm-wine highlife outings from the West African tradition, distinguished by some masterful drumming, but diminished by strangely inept alto saxophone contributions. (Saxophonist Hosea Taylor is more convincing on flute, but even here, he's eclipsed by Ilori's pennywhistle, winningly showcased on the Irish sea shanty-derived "Follow Me To Africa.")

   The separation between the drums isn't great on the recording, and there's too much tinny top on the call and response vocals—but traditional West African music wasn't engineer Rudy Van Gelder's main area of expertise, and recording technology in the early 1960s wasn't what it is today. By the time the final three tracks here were recorded, Van Gelder had it down more sympathetically.

   Each of these three tunes runs approximately thirteen minutes and includes extended horn, traps and African drum solos. Elvin Jones' thrilling and uplifting interaction with the drum choir of Ilori, Chief Bey, Roger Sanders, Ladji Camara and Sonny Morgan is a feature of the mid-tempo groove of "Gbogbo Omo Ibilie" and the hotter and more intense "Agbamurero." Their dialogue continues on the cool-down closing tune, "Igbesi Aiye," which gets into some fine cross-rhythmic work.

   Donald Byrd (trumpet) and Hubert Laws (tenor saxophone and flute) both contribute convincing modal solos to each tune, giving a taste of the aesthetic Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane would develop later in the decade.

   Ilori went on to work Harry Belafonte, Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela. It's taken forty years to release these latest tracks, but they're resoundingly well worth the wait.

   One of Blue Note's less typical releases and a real suprise that is now thankfully available again thanks to the superb Connoisseur Series.While a very strange release in that it is by an African drummer playing High-life with hints of jazz,a little digging suggests it is not completely out of character.Blue Note had released a number of cross-cultural drum based LP's via Art Blakey.These however explored the link between Latin and Jazz rhythms.What also makes this reissue so special is the inclusion of three extra tracks that came from a different session and have never seen the light of day before.Normally I am against such measures and am often driven to distraction by inclusion of endless alternate takes that seem to mar the RVG series.The CD however always seem to delve that bit deeper and bring new gems to the table.In this case the three extra tracks make the CD essential.While the original LP is a fine example of jazzy high life featuring some inspired drumming and vocal chanting it is these extra tracks that stand out.They also feature some well known faces unlike the original line up.There is Donald Byrd,Elvin Jones &amp; Bob Cranshaw adding a heavy jazz feel to the superb drum work of Ilori and his friends.The tracks consist of three long pieces that blend heavy modal passages of playing with the driving drum patterns of the high-life genre.The results are wonderful and makes for some great summer music.It was this sort of experimentation and forward thinking (remember this came out in 1963) that made Blue Note such a huge influence in shaping modern music as it is today.
