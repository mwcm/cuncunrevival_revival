  While listening to three CD's, Robin Trower's " Twice Removed From Yesterday", Jeff Beck with "Beck Bogart Appice", and Lee Pickens with his one and only solo outing "Lee Pickens Group", I realized they all were recorded pretty much at the same time, late in the year of 1972. All were released early in '73 with different degrees of success. "Twice Removed From Yesterday" had the biggest impact, Robin's guitar work with the great vocals of James Dewar that launched Trower's long successful career. Beck's power trio didn't do as well, song's were weaker, lot's of covers and they definitely needed a vocalist. But Jeff Beck went on to greater things.

  After leaving Bloodrock in '72, Lee Pickens put LPG together, and it certainly wasn't a commercial success. It was more of an artistic success. Comparing LPG to Trower's and Beck's as a better listening experience, it falls in between. LPG had all original songs written by the band, one titled "I Can't Stand it" has the same title as Trower's, both different but great tunes. LPG had a better vocalist then BBA, but James Dewar's vocals were miles ahead of both. Lee Pickens guitar work is great, and the songs the band wrote, give him plenty of room to explore his unique style and great tone. Lee's band is tight throughout, and all the players, Bass, Keyboard and Drummer add to the mix of funk, hard rock and country rock. One song, my favorite on LPG "It's Not Right" is a Funk Jazz-rock Monster. LPG may not have been a commercial success, but it was solid and Rockin', unfortunately , Capitol Records pulled the plug on Lee and LPG. A shame really, Lee was/is a great guitarist and that was the last time most of us heard his guitar sing.
