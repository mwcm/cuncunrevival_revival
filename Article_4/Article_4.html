   <u>
    GIORGIO GASLINI
   </u>
  </b>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It’s hard to imagine a musician so central to the jazz life of his country as the Italian pianist Giorgio Gaslini. Born in 1929, he was as fascinated by jazz as classical music and began performing by the end of WWII. An intrepid explorer from the first, he was combining improvisation and the tone rows of Viennese serialism by 1957; a busy film composer as well, he created a score for jazz quartet for Michelangelo Antonioni’s La Notte in 1961. When a wave of American avant jazz innovators migrated to Europe, Gaslini embraced the opportunity, adding guests like Steve Lacy and Don Cherry to his regular quartet. A founding father of Italian free jazz, Gaslini was also an essential figure in the development of the Italian Instabile Orchestra, composing the masterpiece Skies of Europe for the allstar band. When he passed away at 84 in July, jazz lost one of its great international catalysts.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Like many creative musicians in the ‘70s, Gaslini launched his own record label, Dischi Della Quercia, “discs of oak”, both to document his own work and that of his associates. This boxed set collects Gaslini’s own recordings for the label, 11 albums made between 1976-85. The set follows the format of CAM JAZZ reissues of the Black Saint and Soul Note catalogue: the CDs are in miniature facsimiles of the original LPs. The reduced texts can be hard to make out, but it’s a mother lode of interesting, formerly hard-to-find music at an inviting price.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   While Gaslini had plenty of radical associations, much of his music here is set in a postbop mainstream that would have been accessible to an audience open to contemporaries like Woody Shaw and Joe Henderson. It was an era when Gaslini was an ambassador for Italian jazz and jazz in general and several of these discs document or commemorate his travels, including annual trips to the U.S. from 1976-81. He appeared at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in 1976 and 1977, not exactly a hot bed for European Third Stream. Gaslini’s New Orleans Suite has touches of piano interior and ambient sound, but it’s also lyrical and soulful, with tenor saxophonist Gianni Bedori, a regular associate at the time, managing to balance the outside and the funky with some of George Adams’ aplomb.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The contemporaneous Murales, however, is far more adventurous, with bassist Bruno Tommaso and drummer Andrea Centazzo negotiating a minefield of shifting tempos and meters. Gaslini’s intrepid playfulness and sometimes wild eclecticism as a composer are even more apparent when the band expands, most notably on the sextets of Free Actions (1977) and Graffiti (1978) and the quintet of Live at the Public Theater in New York (1980), all energized by the fiery bass clarinet and alto sax of Gianluigi Trovesi.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   What emerges from Gaslini’s various suites is a happy explorer, recalling worldly journeys and launching musical adventures. He was the first Italian jazz musician to play in India and China and the result of each journey was an extended suite. Indian Suite from 1983 is a half-hour work in two parts, touching on some drone-based materials that suggest Indian classical music as well as episodes with the frenetic cheerfulness of some Indian pop. But it’s Gaslini’s own language that emerges triumphant, a fondness for floating clusters and fractured boppish themes (his writing can hint at influences from Monk to Schoenberg, George Russell to Shorty Rogers) among which the Indian elements are merely incidental. The title suite of Skies of China is filled with a delicate light, a springboard for flutist Claudio Allifranchini and bassist Piero Leveratto.

   While Gaslini’s talent as a pianist often takes a backseat to his bandleading and composing here, it’s highlighted in a series of duet LPs with prominent Americans. Sharing, with trombonist Roswell Rudd, is both witty and soulful, including Rudd’s broadly Romantic foray into dance with “Tango-Barcarola”. Ecstasy, with bassist Eddie Gomez, is alive with impulsive virtuosity. The pianist’s rich harmonic invention shines on Ornette Coleman’s “Lonely Woman”, suggesting Gaslini’s transforming solo explorations of Monk, Ayler and Sun Ra repertoire. Four Pieces (1985) unites him with reedplayer Anthony Braxton, the two exchanging lines that race beyond personality on an extended version of Braxton’s “Composition 191” and Gaslini’s “March”.
