   Now Please Don’t You Cry, Beautiful Edith is sandwiched between Roland Kirk's two most popular recordings Rip, Rig and Panic (1965) and The Inflated Tear (1968) in his discography and is often overlooked as a result, and although not as audacious as those two albums it should not suffer by comparison. Kirk’s playing is, as usual, of the highest standard and full of stylistic pirouettes whether playing one (or all) of his reed instruments or his flute, and the tunes are as strong and varied as you would expect on a Roland Kirk release. Opening with the gut-bucket blues of ‘Blue Rol’ which features a prime example of circular-breathing on his solo, followed by an exquisite version of ‘Alfie’ wherein time obediently stands still, we are lead through a shape-shifting programme that should have served to disprove his critics, so authoritative and self-assured is his performance throughout. The title track is as heartfelt and tender a lament as Kirk would ever commit to tape, with a wistful piano solo by Lonnie Liston Smith that is both earnest and unguarded, while ‘Stompin’Grounds’ has a barnstorming multi-horn solo by Kirk that demonstrates more of his fearless inventiveness, a quality that properly defines his entire recording and performing career.
