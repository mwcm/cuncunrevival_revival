  Released during the 1970's, a decade known for decadence and super over-dubbed double live albums. So what does good ol' Johnny Winter decide to do? Release a single live album jam packed with more covers than originals. What was he thinking, right? I mean he could have totally cashed in on a double release. But then again Johnny was never one to do what others expected. That's part of what made him and this release so great.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What we have here is the short lived Johnny Winter And band, and live. A collection of recordings taking from one of the tours the band did while the great (and horribly underrated) Rick Derringer was still playing dual guitar with Johnny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opening with 'Good Morning Little School Girl' it just sets the tone. You can tell this is going to be a good time all the way through the album. Following is an amazing extended version of B.B. King's 'Its My Own Fault' which in my book Winter had already made his own in the studio, and than manages somehow to all over again make it his own here. The guitar solo and interplay between Winter and Derringer here is nothing short of breath taking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So not only did Winter take Bob Dylan's uber-classic 'Highway 61' and do the same to it that Hendrix did to 'All Along The Watchtower' but he had the nerve to try it again here with the even more classic Rolling Stones cut 'Jumping Jack Flash.' It just might rival the original version. In fact I'm sure it does.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moving on the audience is treated to a free trip down memory lane with a medley of early rock n' roll classics which as far as I'm concerned blows the originals out of the water. Roll over Jerry Lee!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  'Mean Town Blues' just cooks but sort of serves as the calm before the storm that is the closing number. A rousing version of Chuck Berry's immortal 'Johnny B. Goode.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnny Winter And...Live is a raw and stellar live performance from one of the all time greats and vital to any blues/blues rock or Winter collection.
