  French Prog band, performing and recording during the second half of the 70's.They were lucky enough to hail from Nancy and have access to the nearby headquarters of one of the few remaining prog-specialized labels, SRC Records.Acintya were keyboardist Philippe De Canck, drummer Bernard Petite, bassist Jean-Louis Tauvel and guitarist/violinst Philippe Clesse, their only album was titled ''La cite des dieux oublies'' and was released in 1978.
  <br/>
  Definitely a unique case of a highly eclectic, all instrumental combo, which seemed to split its tastes between Classical, Jazz and Electronic acoustics, so their sole release was an attractive amalgam of synthetic sounds, Classical drives and keyboard- and violin experiments, all performed with a nice prog touch.Two massive instrumental suites and a shorter piece showcase a band with a rich and emphatic sound, propelled by Clesse's changing acoustic and electric violins and the superb keyboard work of De Canck, including a grand organ, poly- and monophonic synths, a Fender and an acoustic piano.Their sound was somewhere between the Space/Symphonic Rock of CLEARLIGHT and PULSAR and the classicism of WAPASSOU, with the cosmic and romantic themes and variations exceling throughout and the mood for complex instrumental interplays shining all the way.The constant use of synthesizers and the Classical-inspired violin work displays some notable links with Electronic Prog and both long pieces contain lovely segments of Fusion, symphonic and even some Folk elements.Prog Rock music, performed like being Classical suites with experimental arrangements and some great interactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musea has reissued the album in both vinyl and CD formats, the second one containing a couple of live pieces from the band's early days back in 1976.''Le revers du miroir'' is the most convincing of the pair, featuring pronounced electric guitars in the place of violin and cosmic keyboards with some Baroque vibes, the sound of organ is particularly excellent.''Le fiacre des enfers'' sounds more chaotic and certainly more psychedelic, like a second-rate CATHARSIS with neurotic guitar soloing and mascular organ waves on a rhythmic pattern, interrupted by Classical interludes.Very raw piece, which could have sounded more attractive under proper recording circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underrated pearl of 70's French Prog.Classy execution of Space Rock with a huge Classical background and Fusion touches.Among the best French recordings of the late-70's, highly recommended.
