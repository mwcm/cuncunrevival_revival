   Ace was formed from the ashes of a number of '60s English bands, largely the Action and Warm Dust, in 1972.  By the time their debut album came out in 1974 any sign of their past was gone; Five-a-Side was rooted solidly in early '70s pop-soul, based around Paul Carrack's organ and vocals and Tex Comer's bass.

   The sound was something hundreds of other pub-rock bands were doing, but Ace just happened to come up with "How Long", a song about a former band member leaving after revealing he had been playing with another group.  The song was misinterpreted as a breakup song, and the excellent hook (along with Carrack's vocals), they suddenly had a major hit on their hands.  So major that it is one of the well-regarded one-hit wonder songs of the '70s.

   The rest of the album never reaches that height, but "Know How It Feels" would have been a great follow-up, while "Sniffin' About" and "Time Ain't Long" are faster-paced numbers.

   Although the band managed to push out two more albums, they never were able to duplicate the success of "How Long".  Part of the problem was the follow-up single, "Rock and Roll Runaway", was merely okay.  "Know How It Feels" ended up being a b-side.  Flip that around and you have a nice one-two punch that could have made the band more recognizable, although the production would have still been too smooth for them to have outlasted the mid-70s.

   While the rest of the members soldiered on in various bands, Paul Carrack managed to have a couple of hit singles of his own in the 1980s as well as provide vocals on some of the better material for Mike + the Mechanics.

   “How Long,” the song that broke Ace and by many measures defines them, doesn’t necessarily present the most accurate picture of the band or its 1974 debut, Five-A-Side. Sure, Ace had a knack for a soft soulful groove that distinguished them from their pub rock brethren and in Paul Carrack they had perhaps the best blue-eyed soul singer the scene produced (Frankie Miller being a close contender for the title), but neither are the focal point on Five-A-Side, a record evenly balanced between the singer and quintet, as the title implies. Most of the ten-track record doesn’t ride the same easy rhythm as “How Long"; “The Real Feeling” and “Why” come close, containing some of the same ‘70s polyester sheen, but those bear stronger resemblance to the rest of the record, the songs that are heavily rooted in American roots rock, some of which are not sung by Carrack. Ace deftly mimicked the bluesy country-rock of Delaney &amp; Bonnie, choosing to emphasize R&amp;B over shaggy country-folk, thereby sounding quite different than their Band-loving peers. All this gives Five-A-Side a smooth, relaxed quality even on Ace’s relatively harder-rocking numbers like “Sniffin’ About” and that laid-back groove is appealing, partially because there’s just enough grit in their interplay to keep this from being lazy, partially because the songs -- chiefly written by Carrack, who bears eight songwriting credits -- are so strong, excellent pieces of straight-ahead rock &amp; roll and blue-eyed soul that make this album something of a minor gem of its time. [Cherry Red’s 2011 expanded reissue adds a disc of bonus tracks, beginning with the amiable instrumental outtake “Tastes Like Fish,” running through a Peel Session from November 1974, then concluding with a Bob Harris Session from the following month. All the BBC sessions are first-rate, capturing a band just a little rawer and looser than on record, a band making the most of its pub rock classification.]
