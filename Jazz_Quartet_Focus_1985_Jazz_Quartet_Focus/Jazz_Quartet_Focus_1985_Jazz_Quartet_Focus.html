  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “I started performing at concerts when I was 10 years old. I played the accordion and the piano in the accordion ensemble at the Palace of Pioneers. At that time, this was the biggest and most reputable orchestra in Sofia. My concert activity started when I was a child. Meanwhile, there was no recording equipment at the BNR. All musicians were playing live and I am talking here about the early 1950s. We made concerts in Bulgaria hall. I have played for 25 years in Symphonietta orchestra with the BNR and then I decided to start a solo career. I have made many recordings in various genres such as chamber, opera, symphonic and jazz music.”

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Almost all young musicians and part of the singers currently popular in Bulgaria have been my students. I have played together with many of them. They are talented and continue to walk their paths as solo artists. They are already completed musicians and some of them are at a high European level”.
