  Prism is the first album recorded by Japanese musician Ryo Kawasaki after he relocated to New York City from Tokyo in Japan. He recorded additional two leader albums in Japan prior to this album. At the time of this recording, he was band member of Gil Evans Orchestra, Elvin Jones Jazz Machine, Chico Hamilton group and New York–based Jazz Fusion group Tarika Blue led by keyboardist Phil Clendeninn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, musicians participated on this album are his band mates from these groups, Herb Bushler from Gil Evans Orchestra, Abdulha and Steve Turre from Chico Hamilton group and Phil Clendeninn from Tarika Blue except drummer Buddy Williams was a member of George Benson group at that time often played with Ryo Kawasaki on his local gigs in NYC. The entire album was recorded in one afternoon and mixed in the next day to be completed.

  Excellent early work from guitarist Ryo Kawasaki – a set that's got a leaner, meaner feel than some of his more polished later work – at a level that really lets Kawasaki shine throughout! The vibe is maybe a bit like CTI, but looser and more free – with wonderful colors and tones from Kawasaki as he finds his way on the album through a surprising range of styles – with great accompaniment from keyboardist Phil Clenninn, who plays Fender Rhodes, clavinet, and even some noisier Arp at times! The group also features Herb Bushler on bass, Buddy Williams on drums, Abdullah on percussion, and a young Steve Turre on shells – and titles include "Bridge Moon", "Bridge Sun", "Angana", and "Joni"
