  Masayuki Takayanagi (1932), a veteran of Japanese jazz bands since the late 1950s, when he led the Swing Journal All-Star Orchestra (october 1956) and the New Directions Quartet (september 1957) and the New Directions Quintet (march 1958), was one of the earliest noise guitar improvisers, and the first (with Keith Rowe) to use the table-top guitar. Flower Girl (1966) and The Smile I Love (Jinya, 1966) were recorded by a quintet led by the guitarist. We Now Create (may 1969), with the side-long Variations On a Theme of Feedback, was recorded by a quartet of guitar, percussion, trumpet and cello/bass.
