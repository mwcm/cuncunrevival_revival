  Budgie isn't a prog band, everybody knows it. It isn't a prog related band too. I really can't mention any more or less objective reason to get this wonderful HARD ROCK group here in PA. But here they are, so I just want to add my opinion about them, at least to help the unprepared to avoid a shock when listening to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Budgie's music is classic 70's hard-heavy rock. The singer Burke Shelley can sound to the novice as a Geddy Lee clone, but he came first. Good, large riffs, nice solos and a tight rhytmic session are others hard rock marks in what Budgie excels most of its peers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This collection is composed by BBC sessions, outtakes and related material. The raw energy of the band alive is almost touchable thru the radio waves - those were the days. There's a couple of personnel changes in the middle sessions (drummer Ray Phillips out) and in the late ones (Tony Burge). This last change was a hard punch and the group soon quit, only to regroup in the nineties with just singer/bassist Shelley from the classic line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you like hard rock, go without fear. If you expect any progginess I think you should try another band - unless Parents and the middle of Breadfan deceive you about Budgie's merits in this field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final comment: to be honest this is the best Budgie collection I have ever met. The only track I miss is their final gem Panzer Division destroyed. If you can find it at a reasonable price (as I did) buy it without hesitation. If you can't try another way, but you can't miss this babe if you're into hard rock.
