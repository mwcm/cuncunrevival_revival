   Neon Rose was an hard rock band from Sweden formed in 1969 by bandmembers Roger, Piero and Benno under the name Spider; when Stanley Larsson joined the group in 1973 they took the name Neon Rose. Signing with Vertigo Records, their debut album was released in 1974, and was quickly followed with a sophomore effort early in 1975. Following the recording of this album, Stanley Larsson left the group and was replaced by Thomas Wiklund, formerly of Uppåt Väggarna. The group's final album, Reload, was released in 1975 and the group split, with Roger going on to join Wasa Express.

   Piero attempted to reform the group with all new members in 1977, but this incarnation disbanded after recording a few demos. In 1981, the group reformed with Piero and Benno and several new members. They recorded one single for Rosa Honung Records which was never issued.

   In 1969 Roger, Piero and Benno formed the band SPIDER. In 1973 drummer Kenta "Krull" was replaced by Stanley Larsson and Neon Rose was born. Their first gig was to open for Dr.Hook.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Neon Rose is concidered to be one of Sweden´s best hard rock bands of all time. The first single was only released in 500 copies and is very sought after item that gains a high price.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On their first album "A dream of glory and pride" released in 1974, Gunnar Hallin was not a member of the band, but a guitar roadie!

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After the second album "Two" (1975) Stanley had quit to join the blues outfit Nature. His replacement was Thomas Wiklund who in 1971 recorded a single with the band Uppåt Väggarna. Now Roger left the band too, but was persuaded to return. Their third and last album was named "Reload" recorded and released in 1975.After that album Roger quit and joined Wasa Express. He later formed the band Truck in where Thomas also was found.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1977 Piero made another attempt to get the band rolling with himself as the only original member left. They recorded some demos, but never took off. They split....to reform in 1981, now with Piero, Benno, Joaquin Calafell (drums) Erik Svensson (keyboards) and Conny Bloom (guitar and vocals). They recorded a single for Rosa Honung Records, but it was never released.
