   The name of Blue Mitchell is likely to evoke a probable relation between the man and a style, among those who – like me – firstly heard his name thanks to his collaborations with John Mayall, and were thus inclined to believe that if the latter enlisted him, he surely was one of the bluesiest trumpeters in the market;
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But if midway through the opening “Willie” – a soulful Blues in the best tradition of “the Sidewinder”– the listener will be firmly convinced the trumpeter is really at home and comfortable on the style he bears the name of, the remaining material of this diversified set is an unequivocal portray of the Mitchell’s ability to adapt to a broad range of styles.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With his crystal clear yet hot tone and revealing a self-assurance that makes him avoid ever over-playing, and carefully choose only meaningful notes, working over Duke Pearson clever and tailor-made arrangements, counting with the invaluably empathetic presence of long time partner on the Horace Silver group, tenor man Junior Cook and with the pianistic clout of Cedar Walton who functions as the 3rd corner of the octet’s front-driving triangle, Mitchell clearly deserves the epithet on the album’s title.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In an album full of surprises, Mitchell soon proves at home on the rollicking Caribbean/Calypso ambient of his self-penned “O Mama Enit”, displays all the lyricism and emotion necessary to lead the mid-tempo swing of the standard “I Should Care”(and is duly followed by a brilliant Walton and Jerry Dodgion’s alto solo), and shows how to inject carburant on the spirited, Big-Band Soul-Jazz vibe of “Rigor Mortez”, which and contrary to what its name implies is driven by the finger-snapping relentless impetus of Walton and Gene Taylor /Mickey Roker’s  bass/drums engine, and where the pianist answers to Mitchell mix of passion and lucidity with an incendiary mix of imagination and rhythm;

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But suddenly, and as the feeling that a circle has been closed sets in, a drastic change occurs with an unexpected change in ambience and style, the change that eventually makes this such a remarkable album: a young Chick Corea– the pre-solo artist with no recording experience but participations in a pair of Mitchell previous albums –sits behind the piano, and brings in two of his pieces which are like a preview of the amazing compositional capabilities he would display in the future; introduced by the ethereal flute of Dodgion, soon joined by the warm trumpet sound and Corea harp-like piano arpeggios, “Tones for Joan’s Bones”  breathes with a breathtaking beauty, alternating between cyclic swells and chopped off swing, with agile piano  ballets occasionally touched by the gentle breeze of the horns and the trumpet drawing gilded filigrees against their velvety cushion;
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The spiraling and swift theme of “Straight up and Down” morphs into an energetic and asymmetrical post-bop groove with tension building ‘ritardandos’, with the horns reinvigorating the soloists at every chorus turnaround, Corea launching a searing solo, Mitchell displaying an Hubbard like authority and definition, Cook penetrating and tumultuous and Pepper Adams capable of provoking seismic waves with his baritone honks and runs.

   Without ever stepping out front, but nevertheless adding the tonal shade without which the horn ensemble would have not been complete, is the trombone of Julian Priester.

   A wonderful album by Blue Mitchell – one that features some larger arrangements by Duke Pearson, and Blue's soulful trumpet soloing over the top! The use of Pearson is a great addition to the set – as it really sets Mitchell free to concentrate on the best shades, colors, and tones in his solos – allowing him to work in a sweeter, lyrical vein that we really like a lot! The format works surprisingly well for Blue, who could always be a great player, but sometimes faltered as a leader – which is why Pearson's guidance really seems to give the session new life.
