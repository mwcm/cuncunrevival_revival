   Good God was a jazz/rock fusion band based is Philadelphia in the early 1970s. The group was led by guirist Larry Cardarelli on guitar and Cotton Kent on keyboards. Filling out the band were Greg Scott on saxophones, John Ransome on bass and Hank Ransome on drums. They released one album in 1972 on Atlantic Records (with the catalog number right before Close To The Edge - thanks to Dick Heath for that tidbit).

   Rumor has it that band got it's name when they, huge Captain Beefheart fans, called Don Van Vliet out of the blue, and asked what they should call themselves. Good God! was his reported reply.

   Whether or not that story is true, their album, as rare as it is, is highly regarded among fusion enthusiasts.

   GOOD GOD were a five piece Jazz/ Rock band out of Philadelphia and they released this one album back in 1972. We get two sax players although the one also plays the keyboards, plus we get four guests playing a variety of horns. Love the electric piano that is quite prominent and the guitar. Legend says they were huge CAPTAIN BEEFHEART fans, so when they were trying to decide on a band name they phoned him up and yes they got their band name by his sarcastic response. These guys cover a Frank Zappa song and a John McLaughlin tune on this album.

   "A Murder Of Crows" is a pretty good rocking track with bass, guitar and drums leading the way. The horns after 1 1/2 minutes change the flavour though and we get keyboards as well. So impressive. Electric piano to the fore after 3 minutes as the horns stop. The guitar takes the spotlight a minute later. Vocals 5 1/2 minutes in but by the 6 minute mark the horns have replaced them. This is probably my favourite one from their original material. "Galorna Gavorna" is such a catchy tune, it's hard not to move. The vocals and sound bring GENTLE GIANT to my mind but that changes when the vocals stop and the horns start to lead the way. The guitar replaces the horns 2 1/2 minutes in as they continue to jam. Electric piano to the fore after 3 1/2 minutes. There's a bit of a "Continental Circus"(GONG) vibe with the rhythm section. "King Kong" is a Zappa cover and a top three for me. This is a jazzy, horn and electric piano led piece where once again it feels like a jam. I really like this one.

   "Dragon Song" is my other top three and a John McLaughlin cover. This is a powerful Jazz/ Fusion song with plenty of horns and busy drum work. The guitar starts to light it up before 2 1/2 minutes. "Zaragoza" is the first time I feel like it mellows out and that's just at the start of this one as we get piano melodies and lazy horn expressions. It does start to build even by the first minute as things start to get adventerous especially the horns. This lasts for about a minute then the electric piano leads the way with bass and drums. The horns are back and then we get a brief drum solo 3 1/2 minutes in. A calm returns after 5 1/2 minutes. Good song. "Fish Eye" is different as we get a bluesy CAPTAIN BEEFHEART inspired tune. The horns blast to start before it settles right down a minute in as these bluesy vocals join in. I can just imagine seeing these guys in a smoke filled bar at this point. The horns will come and go along with bluesy guitar melodies. We get a lazy prolonged horn solo late followed by a passionate ending.

   This is a really good album that keeps me interested all the way through.
