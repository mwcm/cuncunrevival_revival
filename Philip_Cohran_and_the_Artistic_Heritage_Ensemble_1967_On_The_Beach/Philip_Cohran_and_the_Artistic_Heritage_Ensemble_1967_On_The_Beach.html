   Cohran was born in Oxford, Mississippi, on May 8, 1927. When he was about nine, he moved with his family to Missouri. There, his father became a cook in a restaurant in Troy, while the rest of the family stayed in St. Louis. Cohran played trumpet in bands led by Jay McShann in the early 1950s, and then in a U.S. Navy band.

   He was introduced to the Sun Ra Arkestra by John Gilmore in 1959. He appeared on the albums Fate In A Pleasant Mood and Angels and Demons at Play among others. He played mostly trumpet and sometimes stringed instruments such as the zither.

   By the mid-1960s Mr. Cohran had spent three years playing trumpet and cornet in the pioneering Sun Ra Arkestra, and was established as both a bandleader in his own right and a galvanizing force on the Chicago scene. On May 8, 1965, his birthday, Mr. Cohran and three other local musicians called a meeting at his home in response to a series of nightclub closings, part of a broader economic downturn in the city’s black community.

   In a series of meetings that month, the group established the A.A.C.M., whose goal was to create original music and raise public consciousness through performances and events on the South Side.

   He later left the organization because, he said, he had been uninspired by its focus on free improvisation. But the A.A.C.M. thrived, becoming an internationally known symbol of the avant-garde and artistic self-reliance. It still exists.

   In 1967, Mr. Cohran formed the Artistic Heritage Ensemble, a large group whose trancelike, communitarian music seemed to unite modern funk with Southern ring shouts, and both big-band and experimental jazz. The outdoor concerts he organized at the 63rd Street Beach, where dance troupes performed and vegetarian food was sold, became a citywide phenomenon, with crowds often numbering in the thousands.

   The poet Gwendolyn Brooks memorialized these events, which came to be known as the On the Beach concerts, in “The Wall”:

   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Artistic Heritage Ensemble released a number of albums on Mr. Cohran’s Zulu Records. Its first, “On the Beach,” was reissued in 2001 by Aestuarium Records and is considered part of the avant-garde canon.

   For all his life Mr. Cohran was a ravenous autodidact, studying world history, astrology, health science and musicology and passing that knowledge on to students. He also constructed instruments, including what he called the Frankiphone, an amplified version of the West African mbira, or thumb piano.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Cohran belonged to a generation of artists who exhumed vast amounts of cultural history that had been widely suppressed since the beginning of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Speaking of his early forays into African history, he told the art historian Rebecca Zorach in 2011, “It was like discovering a gold mine in the garbage can.”

   A long-neglected masterpiece, Philip Cohran and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble's On the Beach is finally getting some of the recognition it has long deserved.  Cohran is an impressive multi-instrumentalist, composer, and visionary, with an impressive lineage--both hailing from the Chicago years of Sun Ra's Arkestra (1955-1960), as well as fronting a group that contained members that would go on to greater fame with Miles Davis (guitarist Pete Cosey) and Motown (Master Henry Gibson).  Also, he purportedly introduced Maurice White (later of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire) to the kalimba.

   What makes the first two tracks of On the Beach so impressive is their defiance of all and any genre classifications.  Our instinct is to consider this music jazz because of the preponderance of horns.  On "The Minstrel," however, we will notice Eastern drone elements, Egyptian and African instrumentation, electric bass playing pre-figuring funk, and the soul-singing of Sister Ella Pearl Jackson and Patricia Ann Smith.  "The Minstrel" does feature soloing, but is far too composed to fit loosely into the category of post-bop jazz.  Whatever we choose to call it, it remains a stellar piece of music.  "Unity," though minus singing, continues in this vein.  Cohran and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble are already producing the syncretic music Miles Davis was yet to record.  Unfortunately, the title track nor the closer, "Motherhood," are nowhere near as engaging.  "On the Beach" is much lengthier, less focused, and more solemn.  "Motherhood" is another stab at oblique soul music, but its sentimental lyric renders it far less effective than "The Minstrel."  Still, this is a "jazz" record that is strange without the necessary trappings of strangeness that inhabited Sun Ra or Albert Ayler's records of the time.  Every listener interested in great multicultural American music should hear On the Beach (and its just-as-good-if-not-better follow-up, The Malcolm X Memorial) for its singular blend of musical influences and its exemplary execution.

   Long sought after reissue of this 1967 avant-populist Chicago jazz classic. Includes 2 tracks never before released on vinyl. Phil Cohran is one of America’s resounding jazz survivors. In the late 50s he was introduced into the fold of Sun Ra’s legendary Arkestra, but it is with his own ‘Artistic Heritage Ensemble’ that he really made his name. This record (usually referred to as ‘On the Beach’) is where his virtuoso skill really stands out, and his steadfast desire to create a sound that was different from his peers is obvious from even the opening bars. This is where Chicago jazz (rather than its then way more popular New York counterpart) came into its own, and Cohren is still considered a crucial player in the scene. These days he can be spotted flexing his chops at a local Egyptian restaurant, and he is as much a part of the city’s rich history as Al Capone or the Sears Tower. From the pioneering ‘New Frankiphone Blues’ which used an amplified kalimba as its lead instrument to the smoky vocal-led ‘Motherhood’ ‘On The Beach’ is a gold standard in far-reaching out sound. As AllMusicGuide reviews says "There are too few records like this, too few moments in musical time where everything converges and marries the past to the future in the heart of the now. This is one album no one with a pulse should be without"
