     Stone Alliance toured Europe extensively in the '70s as one of the most unheralded jazz acts of that decade. In the 2000s, group bassist Gene Perla began releasing the recordings on his P.M. Records label. Live in Amsterdam, recorded in 1977 and digitally remastered and released in 2004, is a must-have for jazz fusion aficionados. All songs are original compositions that appeared either on previous Stone Alliance studio albums or Stone Alliance saxophonist Steve Grossman's solo albums. This particular live performance is an all-out assault. Grossman's solos have been described as animalistic due to their ferocity, drummer Don Alias plays so furiously he seems on the verge of turning his drumkit into sawdust. From "Miss T" to the hyper version of "Zulu Stomp," it's one assault after another. Meanwhile, Perla lays down health-code violation funk on the renditions of "Risa" and "Arfonk." Even when they're not in attack mode ("Aunt Remus"), the bombs feel like they're just around the corner.

     Full-on sounds from the mighty Stone Alliance trio – a record that comes on strong right from the start, then doesn't let up for a minute! We love the studio albums from this group in the 70s, but they seem especially on fire on this live date from the late 70s – a firey fusion of the tenor of Steve Grossman, bass of Gene Perla, and drums and percussion of Don Alias! As much as Grossman sounds great in later years, he's got an extra special sort of quality here – one that really makes the album soar with his soulful, almost spiritual solos – which are often brought back nicely to earth from the funkier currents of the bass and drums. Titles include "Zulu Stomp", "New York Bossa", "Arfonk", "Aunt Remus", "Taurus People", "King Tut", "Menina Ilza", and "Miss T"
