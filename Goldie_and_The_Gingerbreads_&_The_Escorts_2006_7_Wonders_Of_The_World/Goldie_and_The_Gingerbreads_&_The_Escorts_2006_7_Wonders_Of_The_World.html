  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads was an all-female American rock band from 1962 to 1967. They were the first all-female rock band signed to a major record label.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Whereas most female bands were ignored by the big record labels and their live performances rarely attracted more than gimmick-seeking crowds, the quartet consisting of Genya “Goldie” Zelkowitz (later Genya Ravan), Ginger Bianco, Margo Lewis, and Carol MacDonald, were among the first to break into a domain dominated by men. They were signed to Decca in 1963 and to Atlantic in 1964.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1962, local musician Genya Zelkowitz (later known as Genya Ravan) was introduced to drummer Ginger Panabianco, in the New York City club where Zelkowitz was the lead singer of Richard Perry's band The Escorts Panabianco was on stage, drumming for a friend of Perry's. This acquaintance with a female drummer inspired in Genya the idea of an all-female rock and roll band. The name of the would-be band was quickly decided on: Goldie was the name given to Genya by her mother after their arrival in the United States from post-war Poland, whilst gingerbread was a play on Ginger's name.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   Richard Perry and the other members of The Escorts were college students. When the summer concert season ended, Genya and Ginger began to look for a pianist and soon recruited Carol O'Grady. Finding a female guitarist turned out to be much harder. Various ad-hoc recruits filled in as and when required, but when they accompanied Chubby Checker on his 1962 concert tour of West Germany and Switzerland, they performed without a guitarist. Organist Margo Lewis, who turned out to be the group's third permanent member, replaced O'Grady and performed with the group on the Chubby Checker tour. The following year, Goldie and the Gingerbreads found guitarist and vocalist Carol MacDonald, who at the time was signed to Atlantic/Atco Records, and she became the fourth permanent band member.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The group's first release on the Spokane Records label was titled "Skinny Vinnie". Although credited to Zelkowitz and Stan Green, the song was, in fact, the Bill Haley composition "Skinny Minnie" with slight lyric changes.

   In 1964, fashion photographer and director Jerry Schatzberg threw a party for the Warhol Superstar Baby Jane Holzer that was later referred to by writer Tom Wolfe as "the Mods and Rockers ball, the party of the year." Goldie and the Gingerbreads were booked to provide the musical entertainment and impressed the assembled attendees with both their music and their inimitable presence. Among the guests at this fashionable and well-attended event were The Rolling Stones and Ahmet Ertegün, the chairman of Atlantic Records, who promptly signed them to the label.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Later in 1964, the band met Eric Burdon and The Animals, whose manager contracted the Gingerbreads for a tour in England. These standard group tours were arranged by record companies to showcase their roster of talent and the Gingerbreads were one of up to six bands on the tour, performing on the same bill night after night in small towns. In Britain, they toured with The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Beatles, The Yardbirds, The Hollies and The Kinks, among others.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Troubles with British working visa requirements led to the band performing dates in West Germany (where many UK and US troops were then stationed as part of the NATO defences) at venues including the Star-Club in Hamburg while they waited for their British work permits to come throug

   A subsequent appearance in Paris at the Olympia earned Goldie &amp; The Gingerbreads a favourable introduction to the French music scene, despite technical difficulties that arose during the performance
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Throughout the early 1960s, Goldie and the Gingerbreads toured extensively throughout North America. Here, the club and venue promoters were not so much interested in their music as in presenting the novelty of an all-female musical group.

   Goldie and the Gingerbread's single "Can't You Hear My Heartbeat" reached No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart in 1965. Although it was also released in the United States, a recording of the same song by the heavily promoted Herman's Hermits was released nationwide with great fanfare just two weeks prior to the Gingerbreads' version, thus fatally undermining the Gingerbreads' chances for their first hit single in the U.S.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Over the course of 1967 and 1968, the group began to fragment as various members came and went.A return to the United States in a final attempt to garner mainstream success there failed. Genya Ravan's strong personality and forceful leadership has been cited as the major factor in the band's split. although frustration due to making little profit from their record releases may also have been a significant issue.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Genya Ravan went on to form Ten Wheel Drive and a career in record production and radio. She produced the Dead Boys 1977 debut Young Loud and Snotty She now hosts two radio shows in Little Stevens Underground Garage Siriux/XM Goldies Garage and Chicks and Broads. Ravan's memoirs, entitled Lollipop Lounge: Memoirs of a Rock and Roll Refugee, were published in 2004 by Billboard Books. Carol MacDonald and Ginger Bianco later formed the nucleus of jazz-fusion band Isis.

Lewis toured with Diddley as his personal manager and as his keyboard player for the last 10 years of his life. In 2011, Goldie and The Gingerbreads were recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame.

   The music from Goldie &amp; The Gingerbreads is unfortunately only available across several samplers. As far as I know, a compilation of this girl band has not yet been released, so I was happy to acquire this complication.BUT WHO WERE THE ESCORTS? I had never heard of them before.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1961, four young men founded a high school group that they called "The Legends". After their first demo recording: "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom", a father of a schoolmate who worked for the record company Coral liked the recording and after the lead singer was replaced , the band recorded their first professional records. "Gloria" b / w "Seven wonders of the world""Gaudeamus" b / w As I love you were the first recordings to be released under the new band name "The Escorts". In 1962 they met singer Genya Zelkowitz in the "Lollypop Lounge", who performed a few songs with the band and soon joined the band. Goldie wanted to sing, to continue studying the escorts .. So Goldie founded her own girl band. It was quite successful, even if the big breakthrough was not achieved. One of her more famous craps, "Can't you hear my heart beat" was successfully covered by Hermans Hermits. It was the same with her version of "Going back" (unfortunately not featured on this album) that became a big hit for Dusty Springfield.
