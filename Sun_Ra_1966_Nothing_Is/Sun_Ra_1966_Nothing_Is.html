    Re-Released in Germany in 1983 as
    <b>
     Dancing Shadows
    </b>
   </span>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1966 Sun Ra performed a series of concerts sponsored by the New York council of Arts which were released as Nothing Is. The tunes were sequenced for LP release, but now, after extensive research, more material from the concert which took place at the St. Lawrence University in Potsdam, New York has been unearthed and made its way to CD. The extensive playing time of that medium has been put to welcome use with the addition of the last three tracks. Besides, the songs have been sequenced the way they were recorded.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Sun Ra's work on ESP not only opened the door to Europe but also to a wider audience to whom he could present his philosophy and, more importantly, his music. Helping with the latter was an outstanding band which included John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, and Pat Patrick, all saxophone players of the first order.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band is in prime form. Sun Ra waves the flag with thunderous chords, a short statement of what is in store. The indefatigable Gilmore turns in trenchant twists and turns on the tenor, his playing tight, gnarled and pithy. As he soars and turns on the wings of his fancy, Clifford Jarvis urges and pushes on the drums before he lets the sax man hold centre stage and have his own divine, which he does with a torrent of ideas. But the clime is free and the band joins in, a raucous soar before space is given its due, the horizon widens and calm descends through the arco of Ronnie Boykins. These are moments to cherish: the music has ridden a roller coaster and then immersed in placid, translucent waters, only to be invigorated again into a collage of red hot colours. There is a lighter approach on "Dancing Shadows, which is apt for the flexible melodic line, a flit from Sun Ra with a hint of boogie. The beat is snappy and the structure tight.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Sun Ra interspersed short tunes that included song with the longer numbers, bringing an agreeable balance to the program. Before the final ninety-second bow comes "Velvet, bopping along firmly with Gilmore, who never finds unusual alleyways to slip into at the helm, with Sun Ra adding a nice interlude before the ensemble closes in. Then there's the nearly sixteen-minute long "Outer Nothingness, a free-for-all that rises on the cry of the saxophone and leads into an intense assimilation of forces that make dissonance the focal point, closed out by a great drum solo from Clifford Jarvis that drives the edge. The vitality that made this music invigorating and challenging is as palpable today as it was fifty years ago.

  Re-released in 2017 as 1966, St.Lawrence University
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recorded live at St. Lawrence University, Potsdam, NY May 18th 1966
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1966 Bernard Stollman sent Sun Ra and his Arkestra, along with audio engineer David B. Jones on a tour of five New York Colleges. When they returned, just 39 minutes of music was chosen to be released as the original ESP 1045 "Nothing Is...". 44 years later, after extensive research, producer and Sun Ra archivist Michael D. Anderson has pieced together the missing parts of the infamous New York College Tour. Recorded on May 18th 1966 at St. Lawrence University in Potsdam, NY, this illuminating document represents the full 70 minute first set, of which ESP 1045 "Nothing Is..." was taken, including an introduction by ESP alum Burton Greene. In addition, producer Michael D. Anderson has uncovered a partial second set from the same evening and some rare rehearsal footage recorded during a sound check before the concert. With over 90 minutes of additional material, this two disc set allows a close up look at the band's repertoire and sound over an entire evening, including the rarely performed State Street and alternate versions of Theme Of The Stargazers and The Second Stop Is Jupiter. Remastered from the original tapes and presented in superb quality, College Tour Volume One is a vivid snapshot of the mid-sixties Ra and his intergalactic band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In Spring 1966 Sun Ra and his Arkestra embarked on a tour of five upstate New York colleges. Recorded on May 18, 1966, at St. Lawrence University, in Potsdam, NY, this illuminating collection presents the full 70-minute first set, a partial recording of the evening's second set, and some pre-concert, soundcheck rehearsal takes.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The nature of the somewhat ad hoc 1966 engineering setup prevented a best-quality audio capture, and there are technical shortcomings in these recordings. Nonetheless, this historic set offers a spectrum of the band's repertoire, arrangements, and stage virtuosity over almost an entire evening. The performance roughly coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Arkestra's debut studio sessions in Chicago, 1956. The sets include the rarely performed "State Street," as well as alternate versions of "Theme of the Stargazers,""The Exotic Forest,""Velvet," and "The Second Stop Is Jupiter." The tour reportedly included SUNY Buffalo, Syracuse University, and several other unidentified colleges.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   According to longtime Ra percussionist Tommy Hunter, the Arkestra often worked with two drummers during this period. A second drummer is audible on these recordings, but he is not identified in existing tour recording documentation. Saxophonist John Gilmore suggested Roger Blank or Jimmy Johnson as the second drummer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The set was compiled and remastered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive from the original source tapes.

   There is nothing quite as breathtaking as one of the early recordings of Sun Ra and his Arkestra. After his explosive and historic recordings The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra Vol. IVol. II were first released in 1965 and 1966, modern music was never the same. It is, in fact, debatable that guitarist Jimi Hendrix was an early acolyte, as were so many musicians of the new wave who emerged after Ra. None had his antecedents—none had descended from the Egyptian pantheon, that is—none had his energy or could see and hear the music of the future as clearly and as wondrously as Sun Ra. This album, The Complete Nothing Is... with tons of undiscovered music from that sainted College tour, brought forth by music historian Michael D. Anderson for ESP-Disk, is priceless.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This album is a treasure of the new freedom that jazz had discovered in the 1960s. Ra might never have wanted to call it that, however. His music had elements of serialism from Schoenberg, mighty leaps in time and the explorations in genre defying rhythmic pulses—and quite simply wholly new worlds of musical experiences that only Ra could hear. All this and the hypnotic chant-like rhythms of the heart and soul of the African experience can be heard here. "The Exotic Forest" with its hypnotic Indian shenai that entwines the undulating bass of Ronnie Boykins and the freedom loving percussion of Clifford Jarvis with the other horns playing contrapuntal arrangements is fresh and superb. When in "Theme of the Star Gazers" the vocalists' sing of a "theme of tomorrow's world...," they were actually being prophetic. Everything that is played on this album is just so.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On "Dancing Shadows," the reeds section of tenor saxophonist John Gilmore, alto saxophonist Marshall Allen and baritone saxophonist Pat Patrick—mainstays of the Arkestra—screaming and wailing with abandon, sound like a myriad horns and give the impression of there being a whole lot more horns than just three. They dominate with fiery passion as Ra's piano and Jarvis' percussion drive the music with elastic muscularity and spatial elegance. Ronnie Boykins' solo on "The Shadow World" is inspired and magical. The frenzied wails of the horns and the plaintive bleating of the trombones make this vintage Arkestra music prophetic as well. Ra's own extraordinary bebop romp on "Outer Space Ways Incorporated" is majestic, original and memorable.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Anderson has unearthed a total of some 90 minutes of additional music that was either cut or never made it to record when the album was first released. CD2 is full of wonderful Arkestra music. The extended version of "The Satellites are Spinning," with Ra's hypnotic comping that drives the piece, and the stellar solos of Gilmore and Allen, make this album sound amazingly fresh. It is music like this and that heard throughout the album that kept the idiom alive throughout the turbulent 1960s and beyond into an indeterminate future. "Velvet" features some superb blowing by Pat Patrick and the trombone work of Ali Hassan and Teddy Nance is exquisite and human voice-like. Ra himself guides the members of his ensemble with exemplary harmonics from behind his piano.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   John Gilmore's tenor saxophone receives more than its share of time to shine in the sun and his honks and bleats are outstanding in his solos, especially on "Interplanetary Chaos." The searing imagery on the extended version of "The Second Stop is Jupiter" is special. Jarvis' pulsating figures holds the music together as the reeds and winds explore the interstellar world led by Sun Ra's piano, and the moment they find their trajectory, Jarvis embarks on a masterful exposition of dazzling polyrhythmic proportions. The drummer employs lightening fast rolls and staccato stabs at various drums in his battery of percussion instruments as he creates a rhythmic edifice of astounding proportions. Later he is joined by James Jackson on log drums as well as by Carl Nimrod and the trio and the trio erects an interstellar city before Ra and the horn section return to bring them down to terra firma only to take off again, space ways. The actual track, "Nothing Is" is actually quite absorbing, but it is the extraordinary pianism of Ra on "Eternal" that has the most indelible impact on the inner ear.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "State Street" is a revelation. Here Ra's writing appears wholly driven by the tonal palettes of the instruments that he employed in the Arkestra. Pat Patrick dominates in the solo department as well as in the ensemble passages. The song's architecture is more like the music that surrounded Duke Ellington than Ra's interstellar expeditions, even though Gilmore's dry, glorious tenor soars mightily into the stratosphere. The closing moments of CD2 are given to a breathtaking version of "The Exotic Forest," which smoulders quietly as it breathes like fire and song all rolled into one. Although the song never veers too far from the Pan-Africanism that Ra also stood for, it swings seductively and is almost like a dirge like chant (although no voices are heard). This closes out one of the most valuable works of music that have even been made by a musician on this planet, no matter which planet he or she came from. It also bears out pianist Thelonious Monk's classic defence of Ra music, when it was chided for being too far out: "Yeah," said Monk, "but it swings." And even though the album ends with applause that appears to have been unceremoniously cut, it is all well worth it. This music is too valuable to be missed.
