   In 1970, Sky, whose members included Fieger, John Coury and Robert Greenfield, was achieving local success in Detroit. Although underage, the band was frequently booked at the concert venue, The Grande Ballroom, as the opening act for a powerhouse succession of groups including The Who, Joe Cocker and Jeff Beck. In a display of youthful bravado Fieger and Coury sent a letter to legendary producer, Jimmy Miller (Rolling Stones, Spencer Davis Group, Traffic, Blind Faith), saying that if he ever found himself in Detroit he should come by and listen to their band, and to everyone’s surprise, Miller took them up on the offer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “On his way to LA he made a pit-stop in Detroit,” recalls Greenfield. “He came to Doug's parents’ house and we played for him in their basement. The next day Jimmy Miller told us he would like us to come to London to produce us. That was the goal we had worked so hard for.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Within weeks of graduating from high school, a seventeen year-old Fieger and his bandmates were on a plane to London and Olympic Studios with a recording contract on RCA records.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With Miller on board, the lineup of musicians that came in to work with Sky reads like a Who’s Who of 60s rock and roll: Bobby Keys on sax, Jim Price on trumpet, Nicky Hopkins on keyboards as well as Gary Wright (who also produced), Chris Wood (Traffic) on woodwinds, and Ian Stewart on piano. Andy Johns (Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main St., Goat's Head Soup and Led Zeppelin IV) engineered and shared producer credit.

   Don’t Hold Back was released that year and work on the second album Sailor’s Delight began almost immediately (in LA and at the Rolling Stones’ mobile studio at Mick Jagger’s mansion, Stargroves); this time with a new drummer, 16 year-old Rob Stawinski. Sky returned to LA for the 1971 release of the album, but marketing was weak and sales were tepid. The band broke up and went their separate ways. Fieger went on to co-found The Knack, but he remained close friends with Coury, who also found success in the music business, recording with Don Henley and co-writing the hit “Last Worthless Evening.” In 1994 he played on The Eagles’ Hell Freezes Over and continued to tour with them until 2000. Stawinski toured with Badfinger before returning to his hometown near Detroit. Of his time with Sky Stawinski comments, “I am proud, to this day, of what we accomplished.”

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After Fieger’s death in 2010 his family decided to go about obtaining the rights from RCA. However, this project was not purely sentimental. Not only did they believe in the quality of the material (all written by Fieger and Coury), but having seen that Sky was frequently referenced on Knack message boards, the family concluded that there was also general interest in the music and wanted to make it available to fans.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Long-time Knack producer Richard Bosworth was called in to digitally re-master the songs. The project interested him immediately; despite having worked so closely with Doug he knew of Sky, but had never heard the songs before. He was not disappointed. “I (was) impressed with the quality of songs Sky composed for theses two albums,” he says. “I've become a fan.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Discovered among the recordings were some titles and mixes that did not appear on the original albums. They have been included as bonus tracks on the re-releases as a treat for those fans from long ago who never expected to hear a “new” Sky song after all these years.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Undoubtedly, one of the most successful power pop bands of all time is the Knack. Their debut single, “My Sharona,” sat atop the Billboard singles chart for six weeks and was the best-selling single of 1979. The accompanying album, Get the Knack, went platinum a mere seven weeks after its release. Yet the Knack is also one of the most controversial power pop bands, with critics accusing frontman Doug Fieger of channeling the sexual maturity of a fourteen year-old and grave-robbing the music of 1960s icons like the Beatles—and listening to songs like “My Sharona” and “Good Girls Don’t,” it was hard to disagree. What many people don’t know, however, is that this was no cynical pandering or knowing  kitsch—indeed, Fieger had already been writing and performing music with the same themes and musical approach for over a decade; since he was, say, just about fourteen.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The earliest recorded evidence of Fieger’s modus operandi appears on the two albums released by his first band, Sky: Don’t Hold Back and Sailor’s Delight, released on RCA in 1970 and 1971 respectively. The band was formed in suburban Detroit by Fieger and John Coury. Though both were guitar players, Fieger switched to bass to form a trio with drummer Bob Greenfield. Still in high school, Fieger and Sky were opening for major acts such as the Who, Jethro Tull and Joe Cocker at Detroit’s Grande Ballroom. With a combination of hubris and naïveté, Coury and Fieger wrote to Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller, suggesting he come to Detroit to hear the band. He did. After an audition in the basement of Fieger’s parents’ house, Sky went to London to be recorded and produced by Miller at Olympic Studios. The results of those sessions appear on Sky’s debut, Don’t Hold Back.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   If anything, Don’t Look Back was a more powerhouse undertaking than Get the Knack. Miller, fresh from his work with the Stones, Traffic and Blind Faith, brought in an impressive array of support musicians: Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Alan White, P.P. Arnold, and Doris Troy. And, of course, at that time, Olympic Studios was perhaps even more highly regarded than Abbey Road. In terms of sales and airplay, however, it was all for naught and the recorded went largely unnoticed.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The songs on Don’t Hold Back are not quite as economical or as hooky as those on Get the Knack, but they are certainly cut from the same cloth. More Liverpool than Detroit, more AM than FM, and nearly straining to be received as a hit record. Fieger’s prurient interests are also well-represented, most notably on “How’s That Treating Your Mouth Babe?,” an unabashed ode to oral sex that predates Lil’ Kim and 50 Cent by almost thirty years. What is very much different, however, is the scope and texture of the arrangements and the production. Get the Knack is nearly a live album—the sound of the band changing very little from one track to another and barely augmented by overdubs or other studio sweetening. Don’t Look Back is much richer and more diverse in its production. “Goodie Two Shoes” is a horn-laden slow grinder with a chorus of female background singers. “Take Off and Fly” is a country-rocker that would have fit right in on the first Brinsley Schwartz album. “Rocking Me Yet” boasts rollicking sax solos over traditional 1950s rock riffs. “I Still Do” is the most Beatle-esque track complete with double-tracked vocals and a major 6th chord ending. Despite this cafeteria approach to arrangement and production, virtually all of the songs on Don’t Look Back can be easily imagined as performed by the Knack and most benefit from such a listening.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Shortly after Don’t Look Back was recorded, Sky replaced Greenfield with new drummer Robby Stawinski and headed back into the studio with Miller to record the follow-up, Sailor’s Delight. The second record is more of the same time, this time adding guitarist John Uribe and Stones sideman Ian Stewart on piano. The songs are a little more sophisticated and a little less Knack-like—or rather more like the Knack of Round Trip than the Knack of Get the Knack. The standout track, “Taking the Long Way Home,” bears a strong Traffic influence and features a prominent flute part.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Sky called it quits shortly after the release of Sailor’s Delight, due to the usual creative differences and poor sales. Fieger, of course, went on to fame with the Knack. Coury worked with Don Henley and Randy Meisner on both Eagles and solo projects. Stawinski briefly subbed for Mike Gibbins in Badfinger during a 1972 tour of America.

   Both Don’t Look Back and Sailor’s Delight have been recently reissued by Doug Fieger’s estate and are readily available on amazon and other internet sites. Each disc includes a few interesting but nonessential bonus tracks. If you’re a Knack fan, track ’em down and check ’em out—and maybe someday later we’ll take a look at Fieger’s other pre-Knack work with the Sunset Bombers.

   I was so happy to see both Sky albums, "Don't Hold Back" and "Sailor's Delight" finally being released for the first time in digital form. I've owned both of these albums on vinyl since they were released in 1970/71, and they have become two of my favorites in my collection. Sky was Doug Fieger's first recording group before going on to form The Knack ("My Sharona"). Sadly Doug passed away from a long battle with cancer in 2010. But these albums present the early talent Fieger and fellow bandmates John Courey and Rob Stawinski possessed as a very tight and solid band. Back in the day, some track lyrics were considered too risque and potentially offensive to be aired on the radio, such as the track "How's That Treatin' Your Mouth Babe?", but today would be G rated.
