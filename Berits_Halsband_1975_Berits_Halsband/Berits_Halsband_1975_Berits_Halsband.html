  A Swedish 70's JR/F septet that produced (to my knowledge) only one sole self-titled and self-released album in 75. BH's line-up is the usual "prog quartet" with three wind players - two trumpets and a flute, none of which members I've recognised in similar Scandinavian bands of the era. The album is made from four lengthy instrumental steamy upbeat fusion pieces, sometimes reminiscent of Secret Oyster (with wind instruments) or Arbete Och Fritid project. Apparently recorded live in the studio on a two-track tape, the album is a small tour-de-force, since nothing could be modified and there are no weak moments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening 11-mis+ Miror I Koket features some steamy electric fusion, with a slower flute section, some Spanish-sounding trumpet section. The calmer (at first) 18-mis+ Flaxoras track sounds more like a cross-fusion of Headhunters and Mwandishi, with some broody moods, but it never reaches the dissonant of the latter or the funkiness of the former. Lindgren's Rhodes is the sonic centre of this long soundscape, which veers slowly Bitches-like around the end. The album-closing 8-mins Halvags Hinder opens on semi-dissonant slow Rhodes and chimes and bells, but drums, bass and guitar gradually come in, before the three winds make their entrance by the 3-mis mark. It gradually picks up intensity and speeds up only to drop out slowly to its end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm not aware of this album having ever seen a reissue, whether vinyl or CD, but if you do find one, or the original vinyl, don't hesitate a second forking out a few bucks, because every fusion fan will find it a worthy investment, if not a must-have. Certainly one of Sweden's best JR/F album ever?
