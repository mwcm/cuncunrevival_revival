   A long-awaited release because it's one of the very few documents of Baker's 1955 quartet with Dick Twardzik. The Scheveningen concert had been available before in extremely poor sound quality as The Lost Holland Concert, but now the Dutch Jazz Archive has unearthed much better quality air check tapes made from the original broadcasts on Dutch radio, paired them with the previously unissued tapes from the Amsterdam concert on the previous day, and released them on CD, so that these historic documents are now for the first time available in a sound quality that you can actually hear what the musicians were playing.

   It is, however, not exactly a revelation. A month before his his first session for Barclay in Paris, it's obvious that the next big step in Baker's musical development was still ahead of him. Throughout these recordings, he appears as a talented, spirited trumpeter, but at the time it seems that he had only just discovered hardbop and was mostly still caught up in the lightweight west coast jazz. It is clear that he was at the beginning of a development when these concerts were cut, but technically, they're not very far from his early Pacific Jazz records. The most impressive musician here is really pianist Dick Twardzik, and it's understandable why his death from a heroin overdose barely a month later is considered such a loss.

   Unfortunately, the title of this CD is not to be taken very literally: these are the complete recordings that exist from the Holland concerts, they are not the complete concerts. This is painfully obvious in what starts as a beautiful rendering of "My Funny Valentine", which is cut short after only 80 seconds when the tape reel ran out at that point.

   It's a showcase of early Chet and certainly a must-have for Chetophiles, it's also vastly preferable to The Lost Holland Concert because of its significantly better (though by no means impeccable) sound, but it's not really an essential item in Baker's discography.
