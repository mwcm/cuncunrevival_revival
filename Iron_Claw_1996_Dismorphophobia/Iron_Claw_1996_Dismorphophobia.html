  Odd, interesting story these guys- basically we are dealing with The Other Black Sabbath.  Some kids who happened to see Sabbath play a really early gig in '69 (actually taped it- earliest recorded Black Sabbath gig, though it doesn't circulate) and had their lives changed to the point where they immediately became basically a Black Sabbath cover band, going around playing things like "Walpurgis" before it was even rewritten into "War Pigs".  Considering Sabbath weren't exactly conquering the world at this point in time, I'd call them extremely ahead of the curve on this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iron Claw themselves probably sound much better now than they did back at the time- during their lifetime they never did manage to put out any official output, probably due to their really pretty derivative nature.  Mostly when I listen to second-tier hard rock bands from this era one can tell why they didn't quite cut it- a tendency to Heep-like material and/or third-rate blues-rock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forty years hence, questions of "originality" aren't really quite so important.  Nobody is listening to early 1970s hard rock hoping to hear something novel, I sincerely hope.  If Iron Claw are derivative, they're derivative of the best: Zep, Sabbath, early Crimson, and if the sound quality is rather poorer (to be honest this tends to be a plus in my book) the playing is, to borrow a song title not on this comp, skullcrushing.  Recommended.
