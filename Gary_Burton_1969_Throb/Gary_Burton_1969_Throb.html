   If there was such a thing as hippy jazz, this would be it. Burton was one of the many jazz performers in the late 1960s being drawn by rock, but nothing rowdy, it’s very West Coast, a sort of Crosby, Stills and Nash of jazz. At least two of the band – guitarist Jerry Hahn and violinist Richard Greene – had experience in Country music, and it shows in tracks such as Chickens and Doin the Pig. So it’s a sort of West Coast Hippy Country Jazz (although the band weren’t based on the West Coast). And it’s all pleasant enough but, with the exception of three tracks, not particularly memorable. Listen to the first track, one of the best: drummer Bill Goodwin and bassist Steve Swallow supply an accessible, swing-a-long rhythm, but while being foot-tapable it’s also dull – and they are the same throughout (I find it difficult to believe that the Steve Swallow here is the same bassist who played with such beauty on Sheila Jordan’s first album); Jerry Hahn takes a lead on the guitar – it’s messy, almost clumsy, but I like that (he is also good on the title track, but a lot of the time he doesn’t stand out); Richard Greene’s violin makes a sort of drone (this is more effective on the title track – the problem with his playing is when he takes the lead, it is light and breezy but could be any of dozens of Country fiddlers); and there is Gary Burton’s vibes – I’m not a vibes connoisseur and I’m used to the vibes players from Lionel Hampton through Milt Jackson who play long lines of notes as though they are imitating a jazz horn, but Burton seems to be doing something different (although on Some Echoes he plays a more normal jazz vibes) – I don’t know how to describe it in any technical sense, but it seems a more static sound, tranquil, a shifting, a creation of an atmosphere rather than a direction. This is most striking on the finest tracks – Henniger Flats, Arise Her Eyes and Throb. Throb is the masterpiece, sounding like a piece of Michael Nyman’s music for a Peter Greenaway film. Too much of the rest is bouncy but inconsequential.

   It must have been hard for a vibes player like Gary Burton in 1969. Bobby Hutcherson was doing moving into uncharted free jazz territory, and Roy Ayers was moving funky prime form--his mallets leaving vapor trails.

   Where did that leave a player like Burton, as talented as his vibe contemporaries but making more conventional, but just as legitimate music.

   I am really not sure, but I hope he sold a lot of records, because one listen to Throb finds he absolutely deserved to. He here has the fire power of bassist Steve Swallow and guitarist Jerry Hahn

   Amazing raw material, raw material Burton uses however he pleases: a psychedelic opener that could be Pink Floyd with vibes, a violin experiment that could work on Frank Zappa's  Hot Rats , blues and trippy ballads.
