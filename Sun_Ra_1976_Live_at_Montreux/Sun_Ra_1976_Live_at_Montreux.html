   Live at Montreaux” marks a slight turning point in the career of Sun Ra and his Arkestra. After playing in obscurity for decades and releasing countless albums on small labels, the late 70s found audiences finally warming up to Ra’s bizarre musical vision and opportunities for greater exposure began to come his way. Unlike some of the thrown together (yet brilliant) albums of the past, “Montreaux” comes in a nice gatefold package complete with photos and extensive liner notes. It was also one of his first albums to actually get a little promotion and visibility from local record stores. Playing and recording in front of the massive Montreaux audience was also a far cry from the little community centers Ra was used to playing.

   Ra quite wisely reacted to these new opportunities by turning out one of the finest albums of his career. With such a large audience on hand, Ra is on his best behavior and cuts out some of his more indulgent humor and goes for a straight ahead sonic blast of avant-garde jazz, some of the best you will find anywhere. With the whole world watching, Ra also seems to have a point to prove about his own playing too. After a few minutes into the first side Ra takes center stage with a tour-de-force piano solo that shows why he easily ranks with some of the greatest pianists of all time. He also does not hold back with the electronics either. Towards the end of side one he brings on massive sheets of noise with a Moog and an organ run through a ring modulator. There was a time when noise meant liberation in jazz, not the sort of conformity to rock power that it has become, and no one brought the noise like Ra did with blunt harsh sounds never heard in jazz before, even amongst the Archie Shepp and Albert Ayler crowd.

   Although The Arkestra is capable of almost any musical style you can name, the avant-garde side of things does dominate this album with lots of over the top “free” solos being passed around to many members of the band. Meanwhile, the band’s exotica side is represented with the quirky “Lights on a Satellite” and the bands ability to transform older jazz styles is heard on a breakneck high speed chaotic version of “Take the A Train”. Overall though, this album does not have much in the way of Ra’s signature big band arrangements, but instead features the players in ever changing smaller combinations that rely more on free improvisation rather than arrangement.

   If you only own one Sun Ra record, this one might be the one to get as it offers a fairly wide picture of his career and some of his band’s most sincere and energetic performances. If you are a fan of Ra’s electronic work and piano playing, this album is probably the best showcase for his abilities in those areas too.

   One of Sun Ra's best non-Saturn live sets of the 70s – a nice little record that shows the group mixing it up with equal parts avant garde and straight ahead jazz, all handled in that ever-growing large group style that made them a real force to be reckoned with in a concert setting! The album was recorded during the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival, and has a bit more focus and polish than some of the other Arkestra live material from the time – a mature, coherent sound that almost points the way towards some of their work to come in the 80s – when Ra and the group were finally reaching the wider audience they deserved.

   The excellent Live at Montreux set from 1976 was released on vinyl by both Saturn and Inner City before disappearing from print for many years. In 2003, the set was reissued by both Universe/Akarma and P-Vine. A full 20-member Arkestra (plus dancers) turns in a typically freewheeling set. From "Take the 'A' Train" (featuring a killer solo from Marshall Allen), to the gospel-influenced "El Is a Sound of Joy," to the almost exotica "Lights on a Satellite," to the free and raucous "Gods of the Thunder Realm," and on to "We Travel the Spaceways," the Arkestra covers as much musical territory in this set as anyone would expect from a live Sun Ra show. This is considered to be another classic in a vast discography. [Completists take note: the Universe edition inexplicably fades out the last four minutes of "On Sound Infinity Spheres," which are present on the P-Vine edition.]
