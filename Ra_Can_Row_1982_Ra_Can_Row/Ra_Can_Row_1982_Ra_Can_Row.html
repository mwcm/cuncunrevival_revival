   Well... nearly. Sorta. It's never quite as deep as the former, and it's never quite as nuts as the latter. But it's exactly as lost in time as "70s Kraut/space rock -&gt; this -&gt; 90s Japanese infinity-psych jams" would suggest. It's got a small handful of precedents and an even smaller handful of antecedents, and I don't have to tell you that none of them were from Cincinatti. The template here is Steven Sailer on drums (and keyboards on A2), Don Schott on bass (usually an 8-string, but he pulls out a fretless for the B-side as well) along with some of the guitar on A1 and all of the guitar on A2 and B2, and finally Rick Biszante playing most of the guitar on A1 and all of the guitar on B1. The opener's got some Mellotron and Minimoog as well, played by a guy named Paul Haneberg who played on this album and nothing else. There's one moment each on A1 and B1 where someone briefly yells something into a very very distorted mic, but aside from that it's 100% instrumental.

   A1 and B1 are the big ol' jamz, both of which *constantly* jump between the vaguely proto-Ozric Tentacles vibes that ashratom alluded to and the slabs of degenerate, effected-to-oblivion headfuck guitar explosions of albums like Get Stoned Ezy. There are tinges of Hawkwind and the live half of Ummagumma as well. Lots of delay-heavy slide guitar glissandos straight from the Syd Barrett era (think the very beginning of See Emily Play), countered by lots of outrageous heavy psych wah abuse. And the two big jams are paced and developed quite well, never getting repetitive, always moving towards something else.

   That having been said, the album never gets better than the opener. B1's close, but it's... I mean, the opener could probably use some editing, but B1 could use it even more. A2's decent, with some Heldon-via-Fripp saturated fuzz and some neat backwards tape effects, but it's slight in comparison. It's the closer that shoots the album in the foot though, a very VERY spaced out nine minutes of reverbed/delayed guitars (and only guitars; no drums, no bass) that goes absolutely nowhere. Both sides end with a locked groove, which doesn't hurt A2 all that much, but with B2 it's the whole-lotta-nothing icing on the whole-lotta-nothing cake.

   Still, it's way the hell better than its obscurity would suggest. Seeing as how it's stuck between two different phases/timelines of psych jamming, you could make the argument it's ahead of its time about as effectively as you could argue it's years behind its time. It's one of those albums that refuses to fit neatly anywhere. And yes, a non-vinyl reissue of some sort would do this thing wonders. It *did* see a vinyl reissue in 2013 on Sunday Records, a tiny ass label operating out of Delaware whose legitimacy seems more than a bit suspect. Outside of that, it's just the original vinyl and its "improved" second issue, both of which were pressed in very limited quantities. Surprisingly, neither issue is super duper crazy rare: both can be had for under $50. And the 2013 Sunday Records reissue can be grabbed for next to nothing... though again, it smells a bit bootleggy. Considering it's been six years since Don Schott told ashratom there was a planned CD reissue, I don't have a ton of faith that's still gonna happen. But it'd certainly be worth it. I don't like seeing anomalies like this thing languishing in the dust almost forty years after its release. There IS an audience for this album, but they aren't gonna find it if they don't even know it exists.
