   Genya Ravan was born in Poland in 1940 and immigrated to this country at the age of 7, with her parents and one sister (the rest her family had been killed in the Nazi Holocaust.) In the late '60s, she became the lead singer of the band Ten Wheel Drive, often sharing the bill with artists such as Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, Frank Zappa &amp; Janis Joplin.

   This recording is the next to last in a series of solo records she made between 1972 &amp; 1979 - and, in my opinion, it's the best of the lot.

   All of the songs are well-written &amp; Genya's sparkling performance ensures that there isn't a single dead spot on the entire album. The style is straight-ahead rock, with an R&amp;B sensibility. There are some nice covers (Back In My Arms Again &amp; Darling I Need You) and some really great originals (Jerry's Pigeons, The Sweetest One, Messin Around &amp; Aye Co'lorado - with guest appearance by Lou Reed - stand out.)

   The album cover might seem to indicate more of a Punk/New Wave style, but make no mistake, this is a rock album - the harmonica/slide guitar leads in Messin Around are more reminiscent of Foghat than any type of New Wave and Shadowboxing could easily be imagined as a Rolling Stones cover.

   If you like powerful rock vocals, this album is definitely worth checking out.

   Genya Ravan is a talented artist who has had a long career. She was lead singer for The Escorts and a founding member of the first all-female rock band although they sounded more like a pop band to me. Goldie and The Gingerbreads toured with the Yardbirds, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and Manfred Mann. Ravan was also a founding member of Ten Wheel Drive and the first female producer. In my opinion, Urban Desire is her best effort although many fans prefer And I Mean It. Up until recently, this great album was known only by fans and music insiders. I noticed it when it came out in the late 1970s. It went out of print and did not come out on CD until 2004. In 2006, Ravan began hosting two monthly radio shows for Steven Van Zandt. Urban Desire recently became available again in CD format in a limited edition. New and good copies are hard to find except at inflated prices. As of 2013, at age 73, Genya Ravan was still performing. Urban Desire is a little known classic with a rough edge to it. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Don't believe me?

   Urban Desire is Genya Ravan creating music on her terms after artistically successful work with producers Richard Perry, Jimmy Miller, and Jim Price, along with the three strong albums she recorded with Ten Wheel Drive. As producer of the prototypical punk band the Dead Boys and their classic single "Sonic Reducer," Ravan was an essential part of the new wave explosion of the '70s, which was a blend of punk rock and power pop. Urban Desire is the quintessential new wave album, and though it caused a stir, it has never fully been recognized as the groundbreaking work it is. A driving cover of the Supremes hit "Back in My Arms Again" has guitarists Conrad Taylor and Ritchie Fliegler fragmenting Deep Purple's "My Woman from Tokyo" riff under Ravan's brilliant New York party atmosphere. That comes right after her duet with Lou Reed, a tune called "Aye Co'lorado," one of the album's highlights written by Ravan and keyboard player Charlie Giordano. Classic girl group vocals, blues sensibilities, and the hard edge of underground rock &amp; roll are the ingredients that propel "Jerry's Pigeons" and "Cornered," while a John Cale signature tune, "Darling, I Need You," becomes a barroom brawl -- and that's thanks to the band assembled for this: Bobby Chen on drums, Don Nossov on bass, along with the aforementioned Fliegler, Taylor, and Giordano. Ravan's harp playing pushes "Messin Around," which keeps up the intensity -- and volume. Joe Droukas, who would author the successful "Junkman" duet with Ian Hunter on Ravan's next outing, ...And I Mean It, brings the disc to a close with his third composition on Urban Desire, a tune called "Shadowboxing." Genya gets mellow with this performance, which feels like Ten Wheel Drive meets the Rolling Stones at the "Memory Motel." A bit of a different groove from the equally profound ...And I Mean It, which was released a year later. Both recordings would make a fine combination on CD.
