   The mysterious Shades of Joy recorded the wholly instrumental album The Music of El Topo in San Francisco, the LP finding release on the Douglas label in 1970. Co-produced by Alan Douglas (famous for his controversial posthumous work on some Jimi Hendrix material), it's an odd but listenable mix of early jazz-rock fusion, psychedelia, funk, and the kind of meditatively somber and pretty music you might expect to hear on the soundtrack to a period drama. And in fact most of the compositions are credited to film director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who was responsible for the early-'70s cult film El Topo. Fifteen musicians are credited with playing on the album, the most noted of them being occasional Grateful Dead/Jerry Garcia sideman Howard Wales (on electric keyboards), though there are also numerous percussionists, brassmen, and flutists; in fact, there are three combination flutist/tenor saxophonists alone. (Jodorowsky himself does not play any of the music, however.) Martin Fierro (who played flute, tenor sax, alto sax, and cowbells, as well as being credited as a "scratcher") seems to have been the musician most involved with the project, also doing the orchestration and horn arrangements. The Music of El Topo, incidentally, is an entirely different album than the Apple-issued El Topo soundtrack, for which Jodorowsky got composing credit for all of the music.

   Recorded in San Francisco in 1970 and originally released on the Douglas label, obscure Shades of Joy's Music Of El Topo is commonly associated with the visionary western-on-acid epic film El Topo by Chilean born Ukrainian Jewish multi-medial artist Alejandro Jodorowsky as its soundtrack, despite another unrelated album on the Apple label being credited as the true soundtrack to the flick. Nevertheless, this intriguing piece of urban jazz funk fusion delivers seven instrumental mantras whose core is neatly amalgamated by the fine art of a great ensemble, here together only for this seemingly extemporized job. The idea of 'soundtrack' is here superbly interpreted and leaves the listener puzzled about the short life of this incredible gathering of exceptional musicians

   Don't make the mistake of picking up the awful 'soundtrack' version of this album on Apple Records - it's not the same at all! This is the excellent original music, composed by Alexandro Jodorowsky and played by an all-star band. The band include the superb Grateful Dead (and rare funk record) keyboard genius Howard Wales among others, so you'd expect it to be good. It is. Excellent, well-produced, chunky organ-fuelled beaty jazzy funk with rock overtones. The best track is the excellent jazzy organ flute-funk 'Desert Is A Circle', as featured on the Mood Mosaic compilation series. Hard to find but well worth it.
