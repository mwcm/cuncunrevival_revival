   At this point in time, Sun Ra's music is not too widely separated from many genres of American music. Just about every music scene, in some way or form, owes a debt to the pursuits of him and the long-term members of his Arkestra. So many Jazz, Rock, Funk, Ambient, New Age, etc. artists utilize modes, elements or methods that Sun Ra had likely touched upon long beforehand. Of course, this is a well known and well documented fact. I can think of a few whole web-sites and at least one print zine that specialize in all things Ra. That said, I consider myself a long time fan of his music and cosmology, and look back with great fondness to the Arkestra show I attended at Slim's in San Francisco in the early 1990's. His music is always worth checking out, and very often worthy of return listens.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Dance of the Living Image consists of rehearsal recordings from a 1974 Arkestra residence in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is Volume 4 of a series called The Lost Reel Collection, issued by the label Transparency. To their credit, Transparency have let the tapes exist as recorded, having only done some remastering for the sake of improved sound quality. And how does it sound? Let's just say that if you're looking for the more frenetic Arkestra sounds, you will be disappointed. These recordings feature a band working out tunes at a very relaxed pace. This gives the CD's a nice, warm mood. Instrument sections weave in, sometimes drop out, and interact loosely. This is all done with Ra leading from his electric organ. He plays chord changes or themes, and then lets the band vamp around them. During the longer vamps, the listener can be easily pulled into the trance states that live Arkestra performances so effectively induced.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Ra sounds really cool in his band leading approach. If there were any Buddy Rich-style control freakouts, they did not make it onto this tape. Background dialog can be heard at times, presumably coming from various players as they figure their parts out, but there are never any admonitions from the leader to shut up. He just keeps playing, occasionally calling out chord changes.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   His organ playing is cool and spacey, both in the way notes are played in sequence and in the cosmic tones he coaxes from it. It seems to me that he spent a lot of time investigating tonal combinations and chord sequences. I'll take Sun Ra's Music of the Spheres over just about any other composer's. I can imagine a day when his pieces will be performed by symphonies as such.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Other sound delights come from the classic, and for Ra, indispensable, horns of John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, and Eloe Omoe. These smart, talented, men, who stayed with Sun Ra for so long, give huge validation to his prowess as a band leader. On Dance of the Living Image, you can hear them work out their chemistry, and it's a glorious sound. Rich, thick, heavy saxophones, played spacey and stately by Ra's dependable crew.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite the fact that he was sometimes derided as an Avant Garde huckster (see if you can find Abbey Lincoln's lowest common denominator description of Ra and try not to wretch), one thing that set him aside from the Avant Garde was his rhythmic sensibility. Most Arkestra tunes and recordings feature drumming and bass playing that is really simple in it's approach. Unlike in the Avant or even in Be-Bop, Sun Ra slowed down and really simplified the rhythm section's playing. Depending on your tastes, this can be annoying or sublime. I'm obviously inclined to go with the latter feeling. Living Image is filled with tranced-out, primitive drumming and bass playing, and it's really great.This approach grounds the tunes and vamps wonderfully, all the while giving the listener a pulse to follow. Sun Ra's simple conception here works in an almost Rock fashion.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Speaking of Rock, there is even some great electric guitar playing on Disc One of this two disc set. The player gets a nice wah-wah sound going, reminiscent of Ron Ashton at his most spaced-out moments on the first Stooges record (imagine what Scott and Ron Ashton could have done with Sun Ra!). It's a great addition to the sound, and I wish there were more of it on the discs.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Dance of the Living Image most likely would not interest the casual Jazz fan, but anyone interested in Sun Ra's repertoire, or the process of creating music for that matter, would have a lot to appreciate there. I plan on checking out a lot more stuff from Transparency.

   The Sun Ra catalog is so vast - during his lifetime and posthumously - that it is oftentimes difficult to locate a starting point or the path in which to continue the journey.

   This December 2007 release is part of the Lost Reel Collection, which is recordings from a variety of sources that chronicle aspects of Sun Ra's career which amazingly may not have been previously available.

   Taken from sessions in December 1974 in San Francisco, this is Sun Ra and a number of musicians trying out new material or tweaking numbers which may be familiar with fans. Sometimes I'm Happy features Sun Ra on vocal, while Watusi is a slow "alternate" take. Sophisticated Lady has a wonderful elegance.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The eight numbers show musicians capturing a full range of emotions, with Sun Ra directing the performance. It has a feeling of a live show and focuses on an important aspect of Sun Ra which needs to be heard to be appreciated.

   This fourth two-CD volume of lost reel-to-reel rehearsal sessions from Sun Ra, done in the vicinity of San Francisco in December of 1974, continues to reveal the inner workings and unpolished, raw dynamics of a band playing with material that in the '70s would garner them an audience unique to jazz, progressive rock, or the then emerging jazz-rock fusion movement. What you hear is Ra incorporating all of those elements for future usage in larger arenas to a bigger audience that was not bound to strict convention, and hungry for new and old music combined. This is what Sun Ra did best. Though in most instances ragged, unfinished, and stopped at will, you hear the enfolded music as encouraged by Ra's verbal suggestions and democratic bandsmanship. You do hear the thin sound and distant cues and wowed tape, but also the laughter and good feeling the band shared while experimenting. It's not good radio fare, but it's interesting to any fan who might be intrigued by how the group came together, making music from scratch. The first CD has Ra on the electric rocksichord for the practice take of "Dance of the Living Image," laying out modal repeated themes, stopping and starting to get the right feeling, and stretching out. There's a dramatic, low-key, spooky, and near macabre vocal by Ra on "Sometimes I'm Happy," a raw version of what would be come a signature tune "Astro Nation" with vocal chanting, and an experiment juxtaposing melodies of "Bag's Groove" and "Footprints" with an Egyptian three-note pulse. The feature on the second CD is a 30-plus minute near drunken or stoned, fun and silly, repetitive workout of "Hard Hearted Hannah" identified by a maddeningly insistent R&amp;B saxophone groove, repeated and eventual alternate chorus vocal line that goes on and on and incessantly on. A sweet version of "Sophisticated Lady," which may be the first recorded instance of Ra's using this rustic Duke Ellington melody, and "Watusi," a longtime familiar flute and horn section-driven 6/8 jungle theme of Ra's, but with new updated changes. Personnel info is spotty, but mainstays Marshall Allen, John Gilmore, Danny Thompson, Eloe Omoe, Clifford Jarvis, and vibraphonist Damon Choice are surely in the band. A purchase for only die-hard fans and connoisseurs, it completes the package the Transparency label offers into the underground scenarios Ra worked hard to conceive and conjure before taking them to the concert stage.
