   Born sometime in 1946 in Hohenhorn, Klaus Hess was among the leading figures of Jane, one of the most significant bands is German Hard Rock history.He had a long and fruitful career with the group, releasing no less than 10 albums over 12 years, before quiting and developing his skills as a multi-instrumentalist.Come 1983 and Hess releases a solo album on the German Sky Records, entitled ''Sternentanz''.Drummers Bernie Van Der Graaf and Rosebud, Jane bandmate Wolfgang Krantz on strings and Uli Reicher on percussion/bass helped Hess during the recordings.

   Far from the sound he used to play with Jane and up-to-date with the more modern sounds and sights, Hess proposed a spacey Electronic Rock album, where his guitar comes in evidence over an enviroment of synthetic stylings, like the propulsive drum beats.He uses constanly an E-bow guitar, thus his album has often a cosmic feeling, often showered by a weird MIKE OLDFIELD-like atmosphere and romanticism.The bulk of ''Sternentanz'' is built either on some slightly psychedelic/spacey moves or on intense and groovier guitar runs, while the floating sound of keys and the rhythmic drones draw comparisons with the German Kraut/Electronic Music scene.The tracks are short with varied tempos and steady drumming, supported by a keyboard background, which is not identified, but there seems to be even some Mellotron sampling beyond the typical synth flows.A couple of tracks are more melodic and sensitive with slight references to CAMEL, while ''Die Hexe'' reminds of his days with JANE, the guitar solos are sharper and more dominant.The title-track and the following ''Lamentha'' sound a lot like SHAMALL'e early efforts with a typical 80's Synth Pop sound sitting next to the guitar distortions.

   An attempt to revive the lone star of Jane was made by Hess and Peter Panka in 1992, resulting to an extensive tour, but eventually this collaboration woudn't last.Hess released a second solo album the same year, ''Technodrome'', which was more Electro/Techno-oriented, before giving birth to his own version of Jane under the name of Mother Jane.

   Unique, synth-based Electronic/Art Rock, pretty similar to P'COCK.Nice guitar work and a palette of synth-drenched soundscapes, which show Hess' talent as a multi-instrumentalist.Not the best album out there, but good enough to gain a recommendation.
