   In spite of massive commercial acceptance, amidst personality conflicts Free splintered in the wake of the release of 1970's "Highway".  With front man Paul Rodgers forming the short-lived Peace and bassist Andy Fraser establishing the equally brief Toby, lead guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke decided to continue their musical collaboration, promptly recruiting Japanese bassist Tetsu Yamauchi and American sessions keyboard player Rabbit Bundrick.

   Signed by A&amp;M (coincidently Free's label), the quartet debuted with the 1971's self-produced "Kossoff Kirke Tetsu Rabbit".  Propelled by Kossoff's lyrical guitar most folks probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that blues-rock numbers such as 'Blue Grass' and 'Fool's Life' bore more than a slight resemblance to something out of the Free catalog.  To be honest, with Bundrick responsible for most of the material the sound wasn't an exact match for Free (as an example Free never turned in something with the Gospel edge displayed by Bundrick's 'Sammy's Alright' - dedicated to his brother).  Elsewhere compared to Free's highly structured catalog, material like the instrumental 'Just for the Box' and country-ish 'I'm On the Run' found Kossoff and company sounding almost relieved to get the opportunity to stretch out and display their chops in a suitably low-keyed environment.  To my ears set highlights include 'Blues Grass' and the closer 'Colours'.  With the album doing little, a reunion of the original Free lineup quickly collapsed with Yamauchi and Bundrick quickly being ushered in for the Free MK 2 lineup.

   This is a surprisingly good album. Normally a group formed after the disbanding of a great band, the rest of members produce a not so good album... sort of revival or tribute, this is not the case. The musicians of Free without Paul Rodgers doing music: hard rock as expected.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But this is not the same as Free because John "Rabbit" Bundrick plays here more keyboards than in Free. In fact in all songs there is a presence of supporting keyboards, making a less hard rocking album but equally enjoyable.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I don't know who was the player who take the singer role among Kirke or Rabitt, but is a decent job done, but in some moments is missed the great singing of Rodgers.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is mainly an album of Paul Kossof, who thanks to overdubbing do a great performance, in some tracks plays up to three guitars, excellently backuped by the rest of the band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I have listen to them many times and I've started to believe that this guys spends lots of hours doing rehearsal before recording this underrated album.
