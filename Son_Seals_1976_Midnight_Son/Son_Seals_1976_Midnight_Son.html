   Armed with a huge, gruff voice and a searing, rough-edged guitar attack, Frank "Son" Seals was one of the finest blues and R&amp;B-performers of the 60s and 70s Chicago scene, and this 1976 album, comprised almost solely of self-penned material, is one of his two or three best records.

   He is backed by the standard four-piece band, second guitar, bass, drums and keyboards, and by a small, punchy horn ensemble (trumpet, trombone and a tenor sax). The interplay between the horns and Seals' gritty lead guitar is absolutely excellent, and just listen to that funky backbeat laid down by the rhythm section on songs like "On My Knees", "No, No Baby" and "Don't Bother Me"!

   "Midnight Son" produced a number of Son Seals standards, songs which remained in his live repertoire for decades, and the arrangements are uniformly excellent. "Don't Bother Me" is propelled by a meaty horn riff and some rollicking R&amp;B piano, and Seals gets off a sizzling solo, same as on the classic slow grind of "Telephone Angel" and the driving, up-tempo "Don't Fool With My Baby".

   Other highlight include the up-tempo "Strung Out Woman" and the jumping soul-blues-stomper "Four Full Seasons Of Love"...but it really doesn't make sense to talk about highlights on an album which isn't anything but.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Get this one, along with his self-titled Alligator records debut, and the powerhouse "Nothing But the Truth", and take it from there! This is a fine, fine latter-day Chicago blues record.
