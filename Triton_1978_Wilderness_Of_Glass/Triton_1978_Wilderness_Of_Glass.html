   This small masterpiece of 'free britannico’ was released in 1978 on Graham Collier's Mosaic, an independent label which, in only five years (from 1974 to 1979) acquired a discreet fame amongst jazz aficionados. It represented the launch-pad for some important work by the likes of Stan Sulzmann, Roger Dean, Howard Riley and Tony Hymas, as well as by Collier himself and by the Wakeman-led Triton. After thirty years this trio's performance is as powerful as ever and, owing to the remastering, Wakeman's tenor sounds even more ferocious and razor-edged. The rhythm section provided by Bridge and Morris is equally impressive: they fill in every small space left available by the soloist, creating a richness of light and shade which adds tension to the improvisation. The only moment of respite is provided by the sinuous magic of Greasy Sunday.

  What a delight! Among my post-holiday junk mail and brown envelopes was a copy of Interplay saxophonist Alan Wakeman’s CD re-issue of his 1978 recording ‘Wilderness of Glass’. Triton, his power trio with Paul Bridge on double bass and Nigel Morris on drums, was a formidable free-wheeling unit that combined energy and excitement with a clarity of purpose and musical direction not always found in the free jazz movement. Having seen the band in the 1970s I was curious about how it would sound today. Would my youthful recollections be re-affirmed, or would my taste in jazz have changed, altering my ability to listen to it again after all this time?
  <br/>
  I need not have worried! From the dramatic opening sounds the album moves swiftly through a huge range of dynamics and gestures that are both succinct and articulate. Motifs and moods have time to develop without being over-indulged, and impressive instrumental technique remains secondary to musical objectives. A sense of focus pervades the album resting on the rapport and responsiveness of the three players. In fact I am probably better able to appreciate it now than I was back in the day, and to enjoy it all the more for all that. After all it can take time to learn how to listen!
  <br/>
  Sadly Paul Bridge is no longer with us. He was a familiar and much-admired figure on the scene, so it is particularly good to hear him again here. I remember playing with Nigel Morris in Oxford many years ago – it was like being next to a hurricane! – and along with all his ferocity there was a musical warmth and curiosity that made it fun as well as challenging. So, good to hear him again as well.
  <br/>
  But listening to this album again now is not about nostalgia. It is about re-connecting with something exciting and strong, that had its origins many years ago but still retains its conviction, its potency and capacity to delight. Check it out!
