   “The Universe in Blue is a fantastic set. The title cut is just a slow blues soloing showcase with Sun Ra's "intergalactic space organ," trumpet (not sure who), John Gilmore's tenor sax, and back to Ra. June Tyson takes center stage for "Blackman", giving a particularly impassioned performance. "In a Blue Mood" (just Ra and Luqman Ali on drums) and "Another Shade of Blue" are just back-to-the-basics blues form for more soloing. Ra sticks to organ for the entire date, and it's just wonderful to hear what the Arkestra does with such a "simple" form. This is a fairly rare, fairly inside date, and fans of Ra and Gilmore's playing will be especially pleased.”

   Universe In Blue was originally pressed up by Sun Ra’s Saturn label in 1972.  Despite their history of pressing inconsistencies (to say the least) Sun Ra’s records usually do hold together with their own extra-terrestrial logic.  Containing five Ra originals, Side A contains the title cut; a two-part organ jam from the composer himself.   Side B kicks off with some of June Tyson’s most profound recorded moments, unleashing a gospel-ish wail singing about “when the black man ruled the earth” on the show stopper “Black Man”.  Two instrumentals close Side B with the eleven-piece “Blue Universe Arkestra” featuring regulars like Marshall Allen, John Gilmore, Pat Patrick, Eloe Elmo and sometime Yusef Lateef drummer Lex Humphries holding down the rhythm.  It’s an unusually bluesy set (particularly for the era) and yet another puzzle piece to one of the 20th century’s most intriguing performer/composers.
