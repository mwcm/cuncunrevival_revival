   Once more, the extraordinary musicians of Colosseum have produced an equally extraordinary and first-class live album. During the summer tour of 2005 Miles Ashton, the great live sound engineer who runs his own studio in Watford, recorded all of Colosseum’s concerts to 24-track digital. Guitarist Clem Clempson and Keyboard player Dave Greenslade spent long days at Clem’s studio auditioning all the performances looking for that magical mix of performance and natural sound quality and put together a complete show to run over two CD’s. So now, you can enjoy a complete Colosseum concert with the fanstastic voice of Chris Farlowe, the virtuoso playing of Clem Clemspon, Dave Greenslade and Barbara Thompson plus the outstanding bass player Mark Clarke – and of course drumming legend Jon Hiseman.

   Although Barbara Thompson played alongside Dick Heckstall-Smith on the first three original albums this new release is the first featuring her with the band – and she has bought a whole new dimension with her.

   Top notch performance and production &amp; song selection. Chris Farlowe's voice seems to get better with age. Only a couple of slow moments. Wanted one live audio to go along with the 1994 video and decided between this one, the 1971 live album &amp; 1994 reunion and I think I made a good choice. All players seem to get better and better. All are accomplished studio musicians and it really shows. They really get into a groove that you just don't hear in today's bands.
