   The emphasis is on color and sound on this spirited avant-garde album. Four of the five selections feature the adventurous tenor of Frank Lowe with trumpeter Lester Bowie, trombonist Joseph Bowie, cellist Abdul Wadud and either Steve Reid or Bob Shaw on drums. They perform two Lowe originals and two pieces by Thelonious Monk; these renditions are full of surprises and contrasts. In addition, Lowe is heard with an unknown group of local musicians called "the Memphis Four" on "Chu's Blues" in 1974. Open-eared listeners should find this set to be quite stimulating.

   One of the better recordings created for the Arista/Freedom series, rather than licensed from tapes Alan Bates had already produced for Black Lion – and a nice set of loft jazz played by Lowe with help from Lester and Joseph Bowie, Abdul Wadud, Steve Reid, and Charles Bobo Shaw. The group play 2 Monk tracks, "Epistrophy" and "Mysterioso", plus 2 Lowe originals, "Play Some Blues" and "Fresh", with a sound befitting the title track, approaching the new thing with a respect for the swing and blues roots of jazz. The final track "Chu's Blues", is a little different from the rest of the LP, a great grooving number that was performed by Lowe in Memphis, with help from the Memphis Four.
