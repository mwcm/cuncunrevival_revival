  ELEKTRIKTUS have been considered as one of almost forgotten Italian progressive rock project in late 1970s, but currently reappreciated as a cornerstone of Italian progressive electronic scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An enthusiastic young musician Andrea CENTAZZO, much immersed into improvised jazz percussion, was in the same time very attracted by the novel electronic music from Germany and England. His enthusiasm could make him purchase his first four track recorder and a couple of primitive analogue keyboards. Andrea got started composing, playing, overdubbing in his studio on the hills of Friuli, just at this moment ELEKTRIKTUS - from the blend of the two words Electronic and Ictus, the name of his first jazz trio - could be born.

  ELEKTRIKTUS is the project of one Andrea Centazzo who hails from Italy. "Electronic Mind Waves" was released in 1976. In the liner notes he talks about the times in the early to mid seventies not only in Italy but across Europe where there was this cultural revolution going on. It was a time of riots and extreme political tension.There were bombings and terrorism and in this climate bands would show their support for the left by playing Jazz or Avant- garde music. Certainly the lyrics were also a way to show support as well.They were not going to conform.Andrea immersed himself in all of this between 1973-1977. While he was a free Jazz percussionist he had a great admiration for the Electronics movement, especially with what was going on in Germany. With the money he had earned from being a musician he bought one of the first four track recorders and a couple of primitive analogue keyboards. In the silence of his own studio on the hills of Friuli he started composing, playing and overdubbing. ELEKTRIKTUS was born.The name is a combination of the name of his free Jazz trio (ICTUS) and the word electronic. He talks about the joy he felt in being able to express himself with a new media like the synthesizer.

  "Frequencer Departure" is really only one of two tracks where the sequencer is prominant. In fact i'd wondered what i'd got myself into after listening to this first track. It starts off with a door slamming then a car starting and leaving then the sequncers come in and absolutely dominate in a way I hadn't heard before. It does settle right down after 3 minutes as spacey sounds take over and hover.Very atmospheric to the end. "Flying A Day- Break" has these pulsating sounds as these twitterings join in.Some bass guitar also joins in then percussion as it builds. "First Wave" has a dark and eerie vibe to it. Sounds echo before 2 minutes then that earlier soundscape returns as contrasts continue. Great track !

  "Power Hallucination" has a good beat to it as spacey sounds and synths help out. A definite favourite. "Second Wave" has this beat with spacey synths.This is the third straight track that is absolutely fantastic. And they keep coming with "Implosion" where we get these spacey sounds that come in waves. "Third Wave" starts with a beat as the synths blow in sounding almost like orchestral strings. "Flying A Sunset" has these almost sparse sequencer sounds but not really in a rhythm as a somewhat dark and spacey atmosphere joins in.That car is back as it pulls up and is shut off as the door is open and closed. "Freequencer Arrival" is the dreamy and spacey closing number.

  This was a pleasant surprise to say the least. Love the cover art as well.
