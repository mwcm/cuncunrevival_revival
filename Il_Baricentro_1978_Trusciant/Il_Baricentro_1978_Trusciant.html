   This Italian funky progressive/fusion album is absolutely charming and funny. The influences are so numerous that it is impossible to mention all of them. The miscellaneous keyboards and percussions are very nervous and complex; the keyboards can be also very floating and relaxing. There are rhythmic piano, moog solos a la Triumvirat, rhythmic organ, and the album has an obvious jazzy/funky influence a la Weather Report of the 70's. The VERY elaborated, precise and fast drums have a structured Phil Collins' or Bill bruford's style of the mid 70's. There are TONS of miscellaneous Latin &amp; African percussions. The bass is quite loud and elaborated. The album is fully instrumental.

   The first track "Karwan" is very rhythmic and nervous; it contains rhythmic organ &amp; piano, vibraphone-like melodies and TONS of carnivalesque drums &amp; percussions. The second track "Trusciant" begins with an excellent Baroque piano part a la John Tout (Renaissance), then the music becomes quite structured and rhythmic, with a military drumming and fast electric piano notes a la PFM's "Chocolate Kings"; some fast keyboards reminds me some Eddie Jobson's solos with UK. The piano solo is very jazzy and elaborated. There is even a short weird bit which recalls me the Goblin's "Suspiria" album! "Falo'" is a very rhythmic and pleasant track to listen; the elaborated &amp; joyful rhythmic piano, the drums, the bass, the electric guitars and the percussions are perfectly synchronized. The "Akua" track is very mellow and relaxing: it contains ethereal &amp; echoed moog notes, delicate piano, drums and percussions: it slightly reminds me a more simple mellow part of the Happy The Man of the 70's. The next track "Flox" has a Brand X and Weather Report sound and style, with wah-wah electric piano, Collins-esque drums in an overall funky Carnival atmosphere. The first mellow and floating part on the "Font'amara" track has a bit the sound of a relaxing Pat Metheny's track with Lyle Mays on piano and on floating keyboards. The VERY fully interlocking second part contains excellent harpsichord, rhythmic piano, organ and moog: it is an absolute demonstration of perfect synchronization: it ends with a delightful &amp; rhythmic combination of clavinet, acoustic &amp; electric piano. The last track "Vivo" has a piano intro comparable to Keith Emerson's work; the track then continues with an impressive fast &amp; jazzy piano &amp; drums performance, well supported by a loud and punchy bass. The album is unfortunately short: around 32 minutes.
