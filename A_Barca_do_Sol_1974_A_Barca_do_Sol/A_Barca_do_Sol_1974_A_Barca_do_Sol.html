   Now is the moment where I have to silence my heart to be able to hear my mind. but it's tough! Listening to A BARCA DO SOL, and more specifically their homonymous 1974 debut is like doing a regression to some of the most beautiful days of my youth years; also some hard moments when my beloved country was ruled by a dictatorship may be displayed there. I had to hear and re- hear again and again "A Barca Do Sol" and I have to confess that goose bumps and wet eyes appeared frequently. Anyway, life goes on.

   What band were they? To be short: simply a fine group of some of the most talented musicians who played in Brazil in the 1970s. Jacques Morelenbaum, leader, cello player and main vocalist, is nowadays one of the most celebrated Brazilian maestros; Ritchie, an English-born artist, soon engaged with legendary band Vimana (hard-progressive stuff with only a single issued) and later trailed a new-wave singer career; the other fellows, like Nando Carneiro, Beto Resende and Alan Pierre, are all of them Premier League people; last but not the least, the producer and inspirational personality, Egberto Gismonti, a giant that needs no introduction. Another curiosity: they started playing as a backing band for a bossa-nova singer - very weird!

   What kind of music did they play? Folk or folk-progressive, doubtless. Although they were basically city guys it's clear that they researched a lot to grab all possible sounds emanating from Brazil's heart of the country. Lyrics are great, very introspective and a bit sour, but generally with fine poetry; on-line translation cannot help here, unfortunately and even experienced translators may have some problems with so many references that are hard to display in a different language. There's a torrent of singing parts which may frighten foreign ears but the musical solutions are awesome: cello, viola, flutes and guitars work splendidly.

   All songs keep a certain resemblance among them providing the album with a conceptual soul, not totally right unless you could focus the action in its related time - tough if you don't live the place and time. 'A primeira batalha', the opening track is an exquisite and amusing song, with a noticeable South American aroma which is pretty and pleasant. 'Arremesso', probably the best album's track, is full of reminiscences with its poignant and sorrowful vocals and accompaniment; this particular song is when my heart beats franticly for so many remembrances of lived times.

   'Lady Jane' shares the title with the Stones' song but it's really another one and a good one too - the Brazilian way is so typical and remarkable that the tunes become clearly catchy. 'A Barca do Sol', the title-track and ending song is unique and where the band show their skilful and capacity. Other album tracks are, trust me, from average to good.

   This album presents some of the best progressive moments produced in Brazil during the 1970s and even not being a masterpiece, it's very recommendable to be added to any music collection.
