   Jamaaladeen Tacuma's second free funk effort for Gramavision is almost the equal of his first (Show Stopper). Once again the first four songs feature his regular band (a quintet with guitarist Rick Iannacone and altoist James Watkins) while the second half of the program showcases his electric bass in diverse groups. "Dancing in Your Head" has some of the members of Ornette Coleman's Prime Time (including the innovative altoist); Tacuma often played with Ornette during this period. The lengthy "The Battle of Images" features Tacuma with the Ebony String Quartet and a percussionist, "There He Stood" has the leader joined by percussionists and a poet. Best is "Sparkle," a jam with tenor saxophonist David Murray and guitarist Vernon Reid. Alththugh a bit of a mixed bag, this set should appeal to listeners open to both the avant-garde and eccentric funk.

   This is THE J. Tacuma album as far as I can tell. This guy can do anything with the bass. It's free jazz-like, dissonant, adventurous, and very much CRAZY. For people who liked "Song X" by Ornette Coleman and Pat Metheny. Anything goes and you'll either get dizzy and hate it or wonder if it's the coolest thing you've ever heard; at least for a while, and you'll always be awed by it. It's funky too, in a way that, for someone like me who gets tired of "the funk" pretty quickly, never gets tiresome, without being funklesssss like Fripp or something. If you play bass guitar, you must have this, by the way.
