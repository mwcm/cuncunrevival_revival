  Ivory were a unique band in the sense of being led by a 65 years old musician.It was Ulrich Sommerlatte, a composer born in 1914 in Berlin, who was the conductor of the Hannover Symphony Orchestra at the very young age of 22.Sommerlatte worked for the most of his career as a composer for film soundtracks and radio broadcasts, before listening to Classic 70's Prog and started experimenting with its sound.He formed Ivory in 1976 along with his son, also keyboardist, Tomas.Ivory featured also Christian Mayer on vocals/guitars, Goddie Daum also on guitars, bassist Charly Stechl and Fredrik Rittmüller behind the drum kit.Their debut ''Sad cypress'' was released in 1979 on Jupiter Records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ''Sad cypress'' was no less than excellent, attractive and clever 70's influenced Symphonic Rock in the vein of GENESIS and YES with dominant keyboard and guitar parts and great instrumental passages.Both the long and short tracks are complex, melodic and balanced with some beautiful organ runs and magnificent moog synthesizers workouts, while Mayer and Daum have both a sensitive HACKETT-ian touch on their guitars.Mayer was also responsible for the nice vocal work in the style of PETER GABRIEL.Lots of smooth interplays, plenty of dramatic instrumental passages, dreamy keyboard atmospheres, intense lyricism and series of sudden breaks guarantee a listening close to the best of the Classic Prog tradition.Hints of GENTLE GIANT's more accesible forms are also obvious throughout the listening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Musea Records and Belle Antique have re-issued the album, which now features four bonus tracks recorded between 1983 and 1987.Sommerlatte seems not to have run out of interesting ideas with Ivory's style now being closer to the likes of British Neo Prog but still with an excellent demanding sound.The sound recalls acts like early IQ and ABEL GANZ, being a bit more synth-based with some Electronic touches here and there but deeply rooted in 70's progressive music with melodic guitar work, symphonic arrangements and warm, sensitive vocals.These tracks make the purchase of the CD format of the album really essential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are after innovative, ground-breaking and trully experimental Prog just skip by. But if you are a fan of vintage GENESIS-influenced Progressive Rock and a lover of trully intricate arrangements this one deserves to reach your hands.Not very original music but definitely among the best albums of the style.
