  Never released officially, it was intended to be the third Blackfoot Sue album (their second one "Strangers" was recorded in 1974 but shelved until 1977).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The recording sessions for Gun Running occurred in 1975. It was David Farmer who came up with the idea of a theme running throughout the album, that of using a harpischord on every track. The sessions were completed, the album duly given a catalogue number, and a prototype sleeve was even created by photographer Chalkie Davies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, disaster struck when one of the tapes was erased, one containing many of the harpischord tracks. That, plus the escalating conflict between the band and their management, meant that the album was never officially released, though white label test pressings do exist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alternate album titles presented to the press, tongue firmly in cheek, included Stick With Me Baby, and You'll Wear Diamonds, and Don't Push Your Mother While She's Shaving... both a result of Tom Farmer's irrepressable wit. Any or all of these can be found in various Blackfoot Sue discographies on the Internet, though the officially accepted release title was always intended to be Gun Running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Happily, most of the tracks were finally released in 1996 on The Best of Blackfoot Sue compilation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although 1975’s “Gun Running” was never released, it was a logical follow up with a whole bunch of fresh-sounding Rock ‘N’ Roll vigour. With “Strangers” only gaining a limited release three years after the fact, it is not surprising it remained unissued at the time, but that is no reflection on the contents. They used the harpsichord perhaps a little too much on this album (extensively on “Wanted Gun” and “Pick Me Up Put Me Down”), but it was an interesting innovation for a Hard Rock act. By this stage their snub-nosed riffs could have been seen as a forerunner as the type of Street Rock Eddie and the Hot Rods and even the mighty Only Ones would perfect (albeit with not quite the songwriting skills of a Peter Perrett).
