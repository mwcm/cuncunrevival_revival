   This was the first recording from Eddie Clarke´s personal archive that got released. The concert is from the third of June in 1977. The venue was the Town Hall in Birmingham and it was the first gig on the tour with Hawkwind and also the first gig that was made after the initial recordings of the Motorhead album.

   This live recording has cropped up in so many different and varied releases on CD that it is almost impossible to keep track on. Every time it gets re-issued it also gets a new title. It is therefore quite confusing to try to put together a complete discography of all the different Blitzkrieg releases. Another problem is that the catalogue number or the label is sometimes the same on various releases, or at least they are very similar. And sometimes the catalogue number on the CD is another one than the number you find on the back cover, or the spine. Especially all different German releases with catalogue number 156520, or similar, and labels like Mastertone, String, Trend or Merlin. This means that often when you find a new version of BOB in a discography section or on a sales list, you discover after a while that you actually already knew about it, but you used to refer to that particular release with another catalogue number, or label.

   Another thing that might create a bit of confusion is the mix up with similar releases such as Lock Up Your Daughters (LUYD) or What´s Words Worth (WWW). The track lists on the different recordings are quite similar. Releases of those two are not as common on CD as BOB though, probably because LUYD is an inferior live recording while the rights to WWW is owned by Ted Carroll and Ace Records and is therefore probably more expensive to license.

   Few bands in the history of heavy metal are as road-tested as Motörhead. Since the mid-'70s, Lemmy Kilmister and whoever else was man enough to join the band's ranks have been tearing it up on the road, and are responsible for one of rock's greatest live albums of all time, 1981's No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith. As its title states, the double-disc set Keep Us on the Road: Live 1977 captures Motörhead early on -- including their classic lineup of singer/bassist Kilmister, guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke, and drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor. And while it's not as awe-inspiring as the aforementioned Hammersmith set, it does include quite a few down 'n' dirty treats ("Motörhead,""Iron Horse,""White Line Fever," and "I'll Be Your Sister"), as well as a handful of covers ("Leaving Here,""Train Kept A-Rollin'," and "Louie, Louie"). The sound quality is a bit rough and many of the songs are included twice, but for fans curious to hear what Motörhead sounded like on-stage early on, Keep Us on the Road: Live 1977 is a worthy document.
