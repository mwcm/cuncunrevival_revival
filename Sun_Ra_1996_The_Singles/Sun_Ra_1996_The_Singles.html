   Compilation of rare Sun Ra 7" singles originally on the El Saturn label and pressed in very small quantities between 20 - 100 copies.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Styles range from doo wop, novelty pop, rhythm n' blues, straight-ahead jazz - plus early strains of the free-synth skronk that Ra would later explore in the '60s and '70s.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Hard to get your head around the whole double cd as the tracks are all quite short and fly by pretty quickly. Needs a bit of intensive listening.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Perfect Man is a masterpiece of blurting synth and funky drums - a bit like a forerunner of Blow Your Head by Fred Wesley &amp; the JBs perhaps. That's about my favourite discovery at the moment.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Trying to collect these on original 7" would be a tricky task to say the least - so kudos to the compilers for making this stuff accessible to all. Great sleeve-notes too.

   Sun Ra maintained a big band from 1955 until his death in 1993, even though he was even further out on the fringe of the music industry than Charles Mingus, who only held onto smaller groups. Sun Ra consistently maintained he came from another planet-and his taste in clothes and harmonies lent some credence to the claim-but he also felt he could connect with a broad terrestrial audience, which is why he continually released singles on his Saturn label. Some of these singles were his trademark space-jazz, but most of them were more down-to-earth-doo-wop, blues, R&amp;B vocals, swing standards, novelty songs and big-band dance numbers. Yet they all had the Sun Ra touch, which made them weird and worldly all at once. --Geoffrey Himes

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I realliy do think that if you're going to start anywhere with Sun Ra, this is the place.  Well, maybe not if you're a deep and abiding free jazz fan, as there's pretty much no material here from between 1962 and about 1970, which happens to be the time he recorded the stuff that has brought him his widest popular acclaim among free jazz aficionados (the ESP stuff in particular), but I can't imagine someone being a devoted and committed free jazz fan and not having heard any of his ESP records.  I also can't imagine someone whose musical tastes were such that they'd only be interested in free jazz and not in any of the myriad other styles on display here.  In fact, I'd say this could serve not just as an overview of the many kinds of music Sun Ra produced, but as an overview of Black music from 1954-1982.  (Sun Ra continued recording for another decade or so after 1982, but didn't issue any singles after that time; in my opinion no huge loss as after about that point his work stopped being as consistently brilliant.)  There is doo-wop, blues, jazz, funk, R&amp;B, and more to be found here.  There are recordings of many of his standards, such as Rocket Number 9, Enlightenment, and Love in Outer Space.  There are representatives of little-known but awesome Sun Ra periods, for instance the single version of "Disco 3000" from the month he spent in Italy in '78 which produced some of his finest LPs and the amazing doo-wop groups he was involved with under the name of "Lucifer" (which since has been documented more fully on the 2004 release "Spaceship Lullaby", which is a must-listen and highly recommended in its own right).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Drawbacks:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   1. The sound quality on some of the tracks ("Enlightenment" for instance) is pretty ropey.  This is a known hazard of Sun Ra albums, though; they're not all audiophile experiences.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   2. It's not quite comprehensive, as there is one extremely rare Sun Ra single (Orbitation in Blue/A Blue One) that either was not known about or could not be located at the time this was compiled.  (By "extremely rare" I mean there is, I believe, one copy known to be in existence.)  There are a couple of other minor guest works with limited Ra involvement that aren't here either.  Some of these, like the Wynonie Harris cuts he made his first ever recordings as a sideman on, are pretty great in their own right, but don't really belong here, IMO.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   3. There are plenty of great Sun Ra standards that aren't featured here- no version, for instance, of Watusa, or Nuclear War, or of Shadow World.  But honestly, Sun Ra had so many standards you couldn't feature them all even on a 2CD set.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Anyway, if you want to spring for a 2CD set, I'd take this one over "Easy Listening for Intergalactic Travel", which does an OK job and all but there's too much to Sun Ra to be summed up in one CD.
