   In what would appear to be a re-examination of 1967's landmark John Coltrane-Rashied Ali album 'Interstellar Space', the drummer Ali teams up with then up-and-coming (and now, sadly, recently deceased) tenor saxophonist Frank Lowe for two lengthy exchanges. And given that it was recorded only a few years after the original, one might hope to find some of the same power and spiritual energy. But power is largely lacking from this interesting yet ultimately frustrating release. Ali is fine - always impressive and so polyrhythmic it's easy to lose yourself amongst all the changes. And Frank Lowe, who would grow into a wonderful &amp; unique style as he incorporated older techniques into his voice (catch him on Billy Bang's 'Valve No. 10', where he sounds like Coleman Hawkins half the time) builds up to quite an impressive burst of energy. But at times he seems to be searching about for ideas, and Ali doesn't seem able to help him out. Throughout this rather short album (it clocks in at less than thirty minutes), it often sounds as if the two men were playing in separate rooms, unaware of the others' presence. There's very little of the shared creativity that jazz often supplies. It's good that Knitting Factory has made this once-rare and out of print album available to fans, but it's probably only going to be essential listening for hard-core Rashied Ali fans and maybe Frank Lowe enthusaists.

   A free jazz sax &amp; drum duo in the vein of "Interstellar Space" (hell, there's even the same drummer on both), although I agree with stilton's comment that there are notable differences between the two.  Still, I listen to *a lot* of free jazz, and I'm guessing that those of you less accustomed to the genre wouldn't hear much difference... in any case, pretty much every record will be unique in various ways, even if the players try to exactly copy another.

   Do you like your free jazz ferocious and intense?  Definitely check this out.  There isn't a moment of rest on this album - well, except when Lowe takes a break for Ali's rabid solos.
