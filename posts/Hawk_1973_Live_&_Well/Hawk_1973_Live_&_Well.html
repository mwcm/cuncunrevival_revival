  Following the triumphant release of "Africa, She Too Can Cry," Hawk traveled to England and began work on their follow-up, a concept album about the Great Trek entitled "Slowly Towards the North."  But despite stirring a considerable about of interest in Europe, their record company lost faith in the project and pulled the plug before the album was completed.  Seeking a way to recoup his losses, the band's manager then released the unfinished tapes, without the band's input, as an apparent "live" album.  The release was mixed rather poorly and has muffled sound, though it does possess considerable charm. Had "Slowly Towards the North" been completed, I personally doubt if it would have been equal to Hawk's first two albums, but it would have been a fitting end to South Africa's greatest band.
