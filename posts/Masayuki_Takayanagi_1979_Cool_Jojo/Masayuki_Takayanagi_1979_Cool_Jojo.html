  Guitarist Masayuki "Jojo" Takayanagi (1932-1991) was a towering leader in the Japanese jazz world. A pioneering figure in free form jazz, he led an influential group called the New Direction and recorded many albums in that style in the 1970s.

   Just as the 1970s was coming to a close, he formed a new group called the Second Concept, a simple quartet without horns, to return to his roots: The "cool" jazz style pioneered by Lennie Tristano. On this album, Takayanagi and his band perform compositions -- many of which are based on chord progressions of well known standards -- by Tristano, his disciples Lee Konitz and Ronnie Ball as well as two originals.

  They explore and extend the cool style characterized by logical and linear, bebop-based improvisations. On a few tunes, Takayanagi uses an octave-box effector to simulate the "octave" playing a la Wes Montgomery. This Blu-spec CD reissue includes four alternate takes as bonus tracks.
