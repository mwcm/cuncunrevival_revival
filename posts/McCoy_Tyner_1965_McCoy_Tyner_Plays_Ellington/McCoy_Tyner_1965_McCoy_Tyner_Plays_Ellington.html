   McCoy Tyner playing Ellington is not a bad concept per se, especially with Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones on board, but who thought it was a good idea to bring in congas and Latin percussion? Tyner seems not to be too excited about it either, as he has given more inspired performances.

   Released at the time when the bossa nova craze had hit and was waning again, this album became a victim of its time when record label heads thought that a few congas would double an album's sale. They probably even did, but they left us with a rather peculiar document. Strangely, some of it even works, but the few conga-less tracks leave you wishing they had approached this differently.

   Thoroughly enjoyable classic jazz interpretations which benefit greatly from Tyner's modal stylings. Laid-back and fancy-free pianistics never fail to grab your attention, while Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison admirably conjure the rhythmic magic of the Coltrane quartet, which had truly become a force to be reckoned with by that time.

   For some odd reason (as noted by another person below), the minor-tinged rendition of "It Don't Mean a Thing" and slow and soulful "I Got It Bad", the most enjoyable performances for me, were not on the original record, so be sure to pick up the CD edition featuring those as bonus tracks!

   An interesting project that works quite well. The already-distinctive pianist McCoy Tyner utilized bassist Jimmy Garrison, drummer Elvin Jones, and two Latin percussionists to interpret a full set of Duke Ellington songs (although "Caravan" was actually composed by Juan Tizol). In addition to some well-known standards, Tyner debuted an unrecorded Ellington piece, "Searchin'," and revived "Mr. Gentle &amp; Mr. Cool." This is an excellent outing that displays both Tyner's debt to the jazz tradition and his increasingly original style.
