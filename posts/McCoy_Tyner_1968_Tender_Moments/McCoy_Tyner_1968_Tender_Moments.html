   "Tender Moments" is a very big change from Mccoy's first on Bluenote. the Players have amuch more abrupt approach to the compositions. Along with Spaulding on Alto and Flute, Morgan on Trumpet, Maupin on Tenor, and Priester on Trombone, is the less familiar French Horn work of Bob Northern and Tuba of Howard Johnson. I give a lot of credit to the tuba because he creates this kind of lifting feeling and the rest of the Horns blend in incredibly well. The coltrane tribute, "Mode To john", is a Modal based tune. The Spontaniety it lacks is made for with complex arrangments. Tyner had an inclusive repertiore of tunes and he experimented with different rhythmns and time signatures. "The High Priest", not to be confused with a Messengers tune of the same name, is a Thelonious Monk influenced piece and incidently sounds very much like a Monk tune. "Utopia" and "All My yesterdays" are standout tracks with great dynamics and fluency. Thank you bluenote for reissuing great music.

   On this excellent set, McCoy Tyner had the opportunity for the first time to head a larger group. His nonet is an all-star aggregation comprised of trumpeter Lee Morgan, trombonist Julian Priester, altoist James Spaulding, Bennie Maupin on tenor, Bob Northern on French horn, Howard Johnson on tuba, bassist Herbie Lewis, and drummer Joe Chambers in addition to the pianist/leader. Tyner debuted six of his originals, and although none became standards (perhaps the best known are "The High Priest" and "All My Yesterdays"), the music is quite colorful and advanced for the period. Well worth investigating.
