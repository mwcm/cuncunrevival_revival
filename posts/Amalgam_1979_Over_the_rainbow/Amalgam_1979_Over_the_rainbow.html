  9th Â album by the superb British Jazz / Improvised Music ensemble Amalgam, one of the precursors of British / European Free Jazz scene in the late 1960s and 1970s, founded by saxophonist Trevor Watts. On this album the lineup is a quartet, including guitarist Keith Rowe, bassist Colin McKenzie and drummer Liam Genockey, the last stable lineup of the ensemble before it disbanded in 1980 marking 13 years of activity. The music is written by Watts or is spontaneously composed and was recorded live. This album was originally released on the Arc label, owned by Watts, and was unavailable for many years, which is now rectified by this CD issue. With the guitar and electric bass the sound of the band is close to Fusion, but with the extended improvisations, complete freedom of expression and virtuosity of the performers the music retains all of the qualities of Improvised Music remaining relatively accessible. This set includes visionary, complex and dense music, which is completely unique and unprecedented. Listeners looking for a total musical experience should look no further. This is classic and brilliant stuff in every respect!
