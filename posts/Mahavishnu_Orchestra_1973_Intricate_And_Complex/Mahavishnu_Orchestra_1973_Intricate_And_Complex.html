   The recording of the January 24, 1973 show in Quebec begins (Show already in progress), with an incendiary reading of the opening track of their debut album, Meeting Of The Spirits; explosive, extended and pummeling in its ferocity. While initially more faithful to the original album arrangement than many performances during this era, it is seething with an intensity that far surpasses the studio recording. This intense, high energy opener segues directly into the infectious groove of "You Know You Know," dominated by an R&amp;B influenced bass line and containing tasteful arpeggios and unusual accent placements. The rhythm section of Laird and Cobham are showcased here and show they are equally effective at subtlety as they are at intensity.

   "Vital Transformation" ups the intensity level significantly. In 9/8 time, this composition contains some of the funkiest playing that the band would ever achieve. Charismatic, powerful, and blazing with energy, this is a tour-de-force blend of all the elements that comprised the bands music. The virtuosity of the musicians and the tasteful applications create a sound that was truly progressive in every positive sense. These first three compositions are way beyond the length of the studio recordings and the group's breathtaking improvisational abilities are beginning to reach new heights here. Clocking in at well over half an hour, this opening sequence clearly displays the band taking the improvisational approach to new extremes.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   One of the bands most popular first album tracks, "The Dance Of Maya," follows and it too gets a highly expanded treatment. This piece features an infectious rhythmic pattern that compliments the melodic line. Once the initial sequence has been established, the band suddenly shifts the instrumental focus, with Cobham playing a bluesy 10/8 drum pattern. Many subtle changes occur during the extended exploration to follow, and despite its imposing nearly 18-minute length here, this is certainly one of the most intriguing and accessible pieces for newcomers to the band.

   Switching to acoustic guitar, "A Lotus On Irish Streams" presents McLaughlin, Goodman, and Hammer in a contemplative mode, with a gentle serenading atmosphere. Hammer's acoustic piano propels the track, but it's the occasional speed soloing from McLaughlin and especially the poignant violin contributions of Jerry Goodman that provide the flavor and spiritual atmosphere. The tender melody and superb musicianship serve as a calming prelude to the staggering intensity of "One Word," which follows and begins the presentation of material from the new album. Beginning with a haunting and frightening sequence that gives way to a relatively straightforward jam, McLaughlin, Goodman, and Hammer trade a seemingly endless barrage of solos. Billy Cobham gets a showcase in the middle, beginning smoothly and continuously escalating in both speed and dynamics, preparing one for the explosive second half of the piece. When the group launches back in, playing in 13/8 time, continually increasing in speed, McLaughlin, Goodman, and Hammer all blaze away in a manner that is nothing short of telepathic. Beneath all this, Laird and Cobham anchor things, while contributing to the overall searing effect. Soon to be dropped from the repertoire, "One Word" is followed by "Resolution," a relatively short composition to end this remarkable performance, which gradually increases in tempo, as the musicians ascend toward the heavens, driven by Laird's anchoring bass and McLaughlin's signature minor chords.

   The group returns for an encore, beginning with "Hope, a piece similar in structure to "Resolution." Like the former composition, this unfolds in an elegant, magisterial way, before Cobham suddenly blasts off into "Awakening." Although incomplete, this too has moments of frightening intensity and the telepathy between these musicians is functioning at an astounding level.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The earliest existing 1973 recording of the Mahavishnu Orchestra, this serves to present the band at a critical turning point, just as the Birds Of Fire album was released. The band was consciously expanding the boundaries of their earlier material, finding vast new areas to explore with nearly every performance.

   The Gambier, Ohio performance begins with a pairing of the new album's title track with "Open Country Joy." While both remain aligned with the arrangements on the Birds Of Fire, album, they both also contain extended solos, often explosive and pummeling in their ferocity. In the unusual time signature of 18/8, the interwoven nature of Birds Of Fire makes for a thrilling and intense experience, although one unlike anything most jazz or rock fans had experienced before. "Open Country Joy," a strutting, gradually intensifying urban blues is perhaps the least complex, most easily accessible music the classic lineup ever played, vacillating between a laidback county feel and frenzied rocking power. "Hope" is executed nearly identical to the studio recording, but more penetrating, as it unfolds in an elegant, magisterial way, before Cobham suddenly blasts off into "Awakening." Hammer takes one of his most impressive solo of the evening here, simultaneously playing bluesy Fender Rhodes with gurgling mini-moog embellishments. It eventually becomes a duel between McLaughlin and Cobham and this is unison playing at its most astounding. McLaughlin doesn't let up for a second, interjecting an endless barrage of ideas, while Cobham often does more with a hi-hat and snare drum than most drummers are capable of with an entire kit.

   Next up is McLaughlin's tribute to Miles Davis, "Miles Beyond," with the group again displaying breathtaking improvisational abilities within a funkier context. The centerpiece of the set is "One Word." While not quite as expansive as later versions, this is nonetheless a staggering performance. Beginning with a haunting and frightening sequence that gives way to a relatively straightforward jam, McLaughlin, Goodman and Hammer trade a seemingly endless barrage of solos. Billy Cobham gets a showcase in the middle, beginning smoothly and continuously escalating in both speed and dynamics, preparing one for the explosive second half of the piece. When the group launches back in, playing in 13/8 time, continually increasing in speed, McLaughlin, Goodman and Hammer all blaze away in a manner that is nothing short of telepathic. Beneath all this, Laird and Cobham anchor things, while contributing to the overall searing effect. "One Word" is followed by "Resolution," a relatively short composition to end this remarkable performance, which gradually increases in tempo, as the musicians ascend toward the heavens, driven by Laird's anchoring bass and McLaughlin's signature minor chords.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The "Sanctuary" that begins this final sequence is a tranquil contemplative piece that sticks relatively close to the studio arrangement. Jan Hammer's introspective synthesizer solo weeps while Goodman's wailing violin compliments McLaughlin's guitar.

Many subtle changes occur during the extended exploration to follow and despite its imposing nearly 18 minute length here, this is certainly one of the most intriguing and accessible pieces for newcomers to the band. The performance concludes with an explosive "Celestial Terestrial Commuters." This features expressive soloing from Hammer and blazing call and response sequences between Goodman and McLaughlin. Although relatively short compared to the highly improvisational material featured earlier in the set, this is another thrilling hyperdrive performance. The improvisational abilities of the group were at the most astonishing level during this latter part of 1973. All of this music burns with an intensity few groups have ever matched in live performance. The Mahavishnu Orchestra's tempestuous mix of jazz, rock, and Eastern influences is at its peak here. This is a vivid example of the band taking improvisation to the extreme. All of the musicians are clearly challenging themselves to push the envelope here, with constantly surprising and utterly compelling results.
