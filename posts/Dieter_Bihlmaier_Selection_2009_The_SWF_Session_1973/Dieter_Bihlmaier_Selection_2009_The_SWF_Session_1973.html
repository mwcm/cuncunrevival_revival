   From the vaults of radio station SWF (today SWR) and previously unreleased, this fantastic group with a rather unusual instrumentation (flutes, bass, drums) blow your ears away. They played music you probably haven't heard before. Call it Free rock, living new jazz or just extremely good music, this trio is far out of any limitations. The music of the Dieter Bihlmaier Selection possesses genuine power, where explosive eruptions alternate with lyric moments. On repeated listening the music develops an irresistible pull that we wish to share with all lovers of "good music". These recordings are without any doubt not only of high musical value, they are also an absolute rarity, since unlike the two albums of the Dieter Bihlmaier Selection, they were recorded just in the trio formation flute, bass and drums and without the participation of the vibraphone player. The SWF-Recordings 1973 of Dieter Bihlmaier Selection are an outstanding musical achievement. CD comes with full coloured 12 pages booklet including band history and a lot of photos. Digitally remastered from the original master tape. If you want to listen to more...... listen to Dieter Bihlmaier Selection The SWF-Recordings 1973.

   In 1972 the trio Dieter Bihlmaier (flute), Gerhart Ziegler (drums) and Harry Rettenbacher (bass) came together to form a trio, which, as is not uncommon in jazz circles, named itself after the "leader" and was on the road as Dieter Bihlmaier Selection . In 1973 Jan Jankeje came to Rettenbacher. This cast of the band recorded a radio session for Südwestfunk in December 1973, which Long Hair released on CD in 2009 "The SWF-Sessions 1973".

   The vibraphonist Gerhard Dietz expanded the quartet to record the album "Maskerade" (1974), which was followed in 1976 by the LP "Manipulsation", which was recorded in a different line-up. The band probably existed until the early 80s. With the death of Bihlmaier in February 1981, the history of the formation was finally over.
