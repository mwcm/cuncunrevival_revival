   One quickly realizes the depth of musical talent that the UK had bubbling up from garages, clubs, and flats when you hear a band such as this.  You come to find out that not only is this band not one of the bands that have remained popular or even on the radar screen of most vintage rock music fans, but it's not even that widely heard on this website.  Somewhat surprising.  S.F. Sorrow gets attention, and rightfully so, but this is a totally different sound.

   This is as good as R&amp;B influenced, early garage music can sound.  The sound isn't as clear as one would hope, but that's not as much of a problem with me.  The song starts out with the fantastic "You Don't Believe Me."  Besides the gruff vocals, a song that would not be too out of place on mid-60s Beatles or Stones records.  The album mostly consists of raucous, blues influences numbers that hold up pretty well for the most part.  The band relies on some covers but does pen some original tunes.  The lyrics are average and forgettable but Phil May's vocals are awesome.  Honestly the best songs come at the very end of the bonus tracks.  "Come See Me" and "L.S.D." are outstanding.

   There really are few missteps on this album, which is surprising.  This being 1965, the band failed in fighting the temptation to try a folk song.  "London Town" is really average at best and a prime example of the band stepping out of character unnecessarily.  Overall though, an underrated and important musical work.

   The Pretty Things' second album, Get the Picture? (released December 1965), has not only been remastered from original session tapes so the group sounds like their amps are practically right in your lap, but it's also been expanded to 18 songs with the addition of tracks cut for singles and EP releases from the same sessions. That's enough to recommend it even to casual fans -- this is now a record that's just a few notches short of Rolling Stones level in the charisma department, and pretty tough any way you want to look at it. On "Rainin' in My Heart," they sound exactly like the Stones from the same era, missing only the little harmonica flourish that might have been added on the break. The liner notes go into the history of the group during this period in delightful detail, and the histories of various songs, most particularly "L.S.D.," which, amazingly, was cut as a demo and never redone for release, but just put out the way it was. In their good moments here, the Pretty Things approach Rolling Stones' territory, and even in their off moments, they're flying at the same level as the Kinks' album tracks.
