   Mighty Joe Young, longtime sideman for Magic Sam, leads his own 1970 session on Blues With A Touch Of Soul (Delmark DD-629; 43:18). With Dawkins on second guitar and John “Big Moose” Walker on piano and organ, Young turns in urgent and earthy renditions of Albert King’s “I Walked All Night,” Guitar Slim’s “The Things I Used To Do” and Bill Doggett’s instrumental classic “Honky Tonk.” But he digs deepest here on the slow blues, “Somebody Loan Me A Dime.” Mandolin is not an instrument usually associated with the blues but Yank Rachell sure deals with the ten-stringed instrument in deep blue shades on Mandolin Blues (Delmark DE-606; 58:14). This 1963 session features country blues masters Big Joe Williams and Sleepy John Estes on guitar and Hammie Nixon on harmonica and jug with a special guest appearance by guitarist Mike Bloomfield on seven tracks. Another important document from Delmark. (Keep ’em coming, boys).

   I first purchased this album around 1987 when I was turning on to the Blues in a major league way, and it just embodied everything tasteful and tuneful that I loved about the music. Joe Young and Jimmy Dawkins both hit a nice steady playful groove on this record. The guitar work on every tune is masterful, and as blues albums go the lyrics and singing are all top notch. There is a nice mix of jazz and soul factored in to the album (as the title would indicate), but it never strays far from the blues bullseye. Jordan Sandke and Dennis Lansing add some really delectible trumpet and sax throughout, and Big Moose Walker has some real sweet turns on the 88s and organ. This is an album you can play over and over again and never get tired of, as the guitar playing just seduces you with it's incredible righteousness. Believe me, there are NO bad cuts on this baby! If you love cruising late at night on the open highway listening to the Blues, buy this fantastic record immediately. Your life will be instantly enriched. The last song on the disk, called Honky Tonk, is the only instrumental and is just magical! Get into it ASAP! A real keeper....
