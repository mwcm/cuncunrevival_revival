  The world of Prog music has suffered a recent and dear loss. Lindsay Cooper, is no longer in this emanation of life. Her pioneer work in the early , developing RIO/AG scene (Henry Cow, Comus, National Health, and the later and magnificent News from Babel, among others). Her continous explorations as a composer and performer with a completely and own aquired musical structure, that led her eventually to follow her own nature, beyond the borders of tags or genres, will remain in our collective memory and in this page. This "Music for Other Occasions", could turn out to be the best way to understand, her personal contributions to the now, very structured, RIO/AG language, which were many and varied. And also as a work which will come closer to the Prog world, than the more "classical" later works which are closer to the contemporary "Classical" music concept, (the same as Zappa's, it is like a normal course to be taken eventually by 'Classical Music" disciples, of course not by rule) Anyway!,... A twenty-one, rather short songs effort, it exemplifies the musical-structures, she developed, and the ones she was coming up with at that specific period (1985). But let me be not, misunderstood, 'Music for other Occasions", never loses that undercovered sense of humour (if needed), it is as subtle as good humour has to be. She as a performer, was more than accomplished, quiet daring indeed, but her dynamics (and the other musician's) never pervades the compositional structures, which is a very, very, thin line. This project, if you like, will be the perfect introduction, to a more mature and wise, contemporary music composer. Why? Because she never stopped searching, for her own way of expression. And that is a privelege to testify!
