   The guitar player of Formula 3, in this his first album,as released in 1972 with help from Area members and produced by Lucio Battisti. One of the most heavy psychedelic guitar albums Italy has ever produced in the 70's. This album blows them all away easily! His first solo album, regarded as one of the Italian prog rarest though not particularly representative of the genre, was issued in 1972 when Formula Tre were still active, and was a sort of jam session with important Italian musicians of the time, including Franz Di Cioccio from Premiata Forneria Marconi and Area´s Demetrio Stratos and Giulio Capiozzo along with Gianni Dall'Aglio and Vince Tempera that were later with him in Il Volo. The album was produced by Lucio Battisti under the fantasy name of Lo Abracek. The first Italian vinyl reissue was released in 2008 by BMG, in a limited numbered series.The guitar player of Formula 3, in this his first album,as released in 1972 with help from Area members and produced by Lucio Battisti.
