  In the beginning Kurtulan Express still featured Hammond &amp; Moog-player Murat Ses (besides, he had also been in Mogolar, in Edip Akbayran group, and had a more pronounced place in his own band Agri Dagi Erfanesi). His approach gives immediately a special touch on “Gönül Dagi”, which also features an Arabesque orchestration in addition to the keyboards, drumming and electric bass accompaniment.

  The sound on the tracks sounds very matured, very Turkish, often with a powerful electric touch to it as well. There are different things happening in the music here. We even have a firework with shouts and responds on “Hey Koca Topcu”. The album might have had a bigger production, hence the few extra Arabesque orchestral touches, which are a nice addition. “Vur Ha Vur” has a popular pop/rock rhythm drive, while being enriched by keyboards and electric guitar surprises and funky elements too, some small brass arrangements and some solos. “Dön Desem Dönermisin?” sounds also very self-assured and is a bit more like popular music already, but this doesn’t spoil the album. The small contributions of Murat, the complex workout of the rhythms, the sad-attractive Turkish melodies and the extra touches with electric Turkish violin, work very well. “Ben Belirim” could be taken out for it’s attractive song rhythm, which is being improvised with a second theme and layer with Moog here and there. (-Note that there still exist a second version that was released on tape later-). Some tracks are very rooted in Turkish (folk) music, but still are powerful and mostly come with an additional rock bass &amp; drums rhythm. Other tracks hang on closer to the folklore, even though the context has been changed. Succesful additions are “Cay Eildin Ötteye” which has more Moog/Hammond explorations even though here it still is overshadowed by spoken word and singing rather quickly, and for the same reasons it is good to have also included “Egri Bügrü”, also for it’s attractive Moog and drive.
