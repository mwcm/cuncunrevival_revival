   Winter first came to public prominence in 1961 as the winner of a collegiate jazz festival held at Notre Dame University; one of that event's judges, John Hammond, subsequently signed the group to a Columbia recording contract. In 1962, the band was sent on a State Department tour of Latin America. That venture planted the first seeds of change in Winter's concept. In 1967, he abandoned traditional jazz format in favor of a lineup that featured non-Western instruments. The Paul Winter Consort, as the band was renamed, became one of the earliest exponents of world music, combining elements from various African, Asian, and South American cultures with jazz. Members of the Consort interested in extending the music's experimental component -- guitarist Ralph Towner, oboist Paul McCandless, sitarist and percussionist Collin Walcott -- broke away from Winter's leadership in the early '70s to form the group Oregon. Meanwhile, Winter became increasingly involved with environmental issues. He participated in activities with the Greenpeace organization, and worked towards a successful integration of music and nature. Winter recorded his attempts at communication with whales off the coast of California, and used the tapes as the foundation of his 1977 album, Common Ground. Since 1980, Winter has headed a non-profit group dedicated to increasing public awareness of music's relationship to spiritual and environmental health. He continues to perform in support of his organization, frequently in settings conducive to the production of (and interaction with) ambient sound, such as the Grand Canyon, or New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine; in 1998, he also teamed with Oscar Castro-Neves to record Brazilian Days. Celtic Solstice followed a year later; Journey with the Sun appeared in early 2001.

   Winter Consort emerged from Paul’s jazz sextet, which came out of Chicago during Paul’s years at Northwestern University. After winning the 1961 Intercollegiate Jazz Festival, the Sextet was signed to Columbia Records by legendary producer John Hammond. In 1962 the Sextet recorded its first three albums, and, on recommendation from Festival judges Dizzy Gillespie and Hammond, was sent by the State Department on a six-month tour of 23 countries of Latin America.?The success of this tour led to an invitation from First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to play at the White House. The Sextet’s performance in the East Room on November 19, 1962, happened to be the first-ever jazz concert in the White House. The group continued to tour and record throughout 1963, and made their final album during the week of President Kennedy’s assassination. Then, numbed by that tragedy, and discouraged by what they felt was the end of that optimistic era, the Sextet disbanded and the players went on to other pursuits – the drummer eventually to Count Basie’s band, the bassist to Ahmad Jamal’s trio, the trumpet player to medical school, the baritone saxist to teach at Michigan State, and Paul to Brazil, to resume his exploration of the world’s music.

   Touring with his jazz sextet, close contact with the musical community of Brazil, and a growing interest in the natural world and voices of the earth awakened in Paul the desire to move into a broader realm of music and explore a richer texture of sound. To this end, he formed the Paul Winter Consort. The group incorporated a very different instrumentation from the Sextet, but continued in the same lineage: a spirit of celebration, in the democracy of ensemble, aspiring toward a balance between the improvised and the composed.”

   Paul  borrowed the name “consort” from the ensembles of Shakespeare’s time, the housebands of the Elizabethan Theater, which adventurously blended woodwinds, strings and percussion, the same families of instruments he wanted to combine in his contemporary consort.

   The early Consort recorded four albums for A &amp; M with producers Paul Stookey and Phil Ramon, and one for Epic produced by George Martin, Icarus, which was recorded in the summer of 1971 in the unhurried, unpressured atmosphere of a rented house near the sea. Martin said Icarus was “the finest record I ever mande.” That landmark experience underscored the importance of establishing a place where Paul could nourish his music and his community.

   Paul Winter Consort became a forum for the whole range of musical genres Winter had come to love – from Bach to African music –including as well notable voices from the symphony of nature (as the whale, wolf, and eagle). Winter took the name from Elizabethan times and the house bands of Shakespearean Theatre, which adventurously blended woodwinds, strings and percussion—the same families of instruments he wanted to combine in his ‘contemporary’ consort—and allowed the players to embellish on the written parts. With this group, Winter became one of the earliest exponent’s of world music.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Consort recorded twelve albums for major labels during the 1960s and 1970s. Four albums for A &amp; M were produced by Paul Stookey and Phil Ramone, and one for Epic, named Icarus that bridged small-combo jazz and world music. This was produced by Beatles mentor George Martin, who claimed in his autobiography it was ”the finest record I ever made.” Astronauts of Apollo 15 took the Consort’s album Road to the moon with them and named two craters after the songs “Ghost Beads” and “Icarus.”

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1972, with cellist David Darling, Winter organized a new ensemble, while original band members Ralph Towner, Paul McCandless, Collin Walcott and Glen Moore launched their experimental jazz band Oregon.

   The first album starts off with a bang, with its mix of chamber music, classical composition (like Oregon as usual) mixed with acoustic ethnic elements, guitars, strings, and saxes.  Some stunning compositions appear early on, like the Choral Dorien (not clear who composer is).  Unfortunately the second release, Something in the Wind, from 1969, is marred by quite a few 'karaoke' cover versions of pop songs (e.g. the horrific Mr. Bojangles-- someone please stop his jangling) but here and there appear the shiniest pearls, like a Charles Ives composition called The Indians.  I don't think I could offhand name another rock/fusion/jazz record that has Ch. Ives on it, and usually that's a good thing.  But here, his appearance is a sublime thing, with the chamber instrumentation which I think includes a graceful flute plus varied reeds absolutely raining beautiful music from heaven on down.

   The first Winter Consort blends jazz with Renaissance era music, modern avant garde classical and world music in a manner that would have been quite progressive for 1968. I invite those who have dismissed Paul Winter as just another new age musician to take a listen to this LP back when he was very much a jazz saxophonist. Most of this LP is rich and compelling with the exception "Both Sides Now" which, despite the attractive arrangement, smacks of pandering to the current pop-jazz trends of the late 60's.
