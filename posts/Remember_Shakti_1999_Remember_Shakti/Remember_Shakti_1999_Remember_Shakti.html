   In the mid-1970's many believed John McLaughlin had committed commercial suicide by abandoning electric instruments and Western sensibilities in favor of an all-acoustic group with Indian musicians. In fact, record sales for this group, Shakti, were quite disappointing. Sometimes though, a musician has to follow his muse. In this case, McLaughlin was led to create a very fertile groundbreaking group in the form of Shakti. With all due respect to the very fine group Oregon, Shakti was really the first band to truly capture the essence of what we now call "World Music." Shakti's dependence on Eastern musical models infused with Western jazz-like improvisation made for an exciting and influential stew.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   One doesn't have to look very far into McLaughlin's past to see why such a band would appeal to him. His own inclinations toward Eastern music can be heard on side two of his earlier recording My Goal's Beyond. Certainly, he was influenced even before that outing by the pop mysticism of the times and his own involvement in seeking self-realization through Eastern philosophy. (Not to mention, of course, his study of Indian music.)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   How ironic that 20 years later, a band different from the original Shakti but born from its spirit should emerge to find commercial success. And how ironic that McLaughlin should now turn to the timbres of an electric guitar and forego the sublime sounds of his acoustic approach.

   Remember Shakti is the name of the new group as well as its first live album. The 2 CD set recorded over four nights in England in the fall of 1997 features the two founding fathers of the original Shakti, McLaughlin and the tabla master Zakir Hussain. One of India's most respected musicians, flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia, provides an integral voice as a member of this group for these several concerts. Most enjoyably, Shakti's original ghatam player "Vikku" Vinayakram helps to serve the rhythm.

   McLaughlin plays a Johnny Smith electric guitar for these outings, held in honor of India and Pakistan's 50th anniversaries. The electric guitar and haunting bansuri flute give Remember Shakti a very different dynamic than the acoustic guitar and violin of the great L. Shankar had given Shakti. Both instruments allow for long sustained notes that can carry the listener away.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The tunes here tend to be very long and require attentive listening. Two McLaughlin standards, "Lotus Feet" and "Zakir," are present. The guitarist's beautiful and uplifting tune "The Wish," which appeared on The Promise, also gets the special treatment. Chaurasia appears, sans McLaughlin, on the opening self-penned tune "Chandrakauns"; his "Mukti" features him trading lines with McLaughlin.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Remember Shakti is reflective, serious East-meets-West music. It is not without some hilarity howeverâ€”Vikku's laughter can be quite contagious. It is also not without some truly virtuoso moments and plenty of drama. The deep tones of the electric guitar and the bansuri flute float above the percussive groundwork. A bass-like drone provides sub-surface support.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   (Note: If you enjoy Remember Shakti, it's absolutely imperative that you obtain Zakir Hussain's 1987 record Making Music. On this predecessor to Remember Shakti, Hussain joins with McLaughlin, Chaurasia and Jan Garbarek in a simply dizzying display of East-meets-West improvisational mastery).

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Guitarist JOHN McLAUGHLIN has been building musical bridges between East and West for most of his professional career, but this 1999 double-disc represents maybe the purest expression yet of his love for classic Indian music and philosophy.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All the same, these performances (recorded live in England over four concerts in 1997) aren't for everyone. The band assembled here isn't the same SHAKTI of McLaughlin's post-MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA years, and the music has its source in a foreign tradition far removed from his earlier Jazz Rock innovations. This is true fusion: not merely of musical styles, but of whole musical cultures, and needs to be approached from an entirely different perspective.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The songs are built around long instrumental improvisations (sometimes very long: "Mukti" clocks in at a staggering 63+ minutes!), in classic raga fashion allowing plenty of time for gradual thematic development and resolution, and with no shortage of virtuoso interplay between the players, numbering anywhere between two and five at a time. McLaughlin himself is hardly the star of the show, or at least not the only one. At times he's almost more of a guest among the other, Indian musicians, and in fact doesn't even play on the opening track, "Chandrakauns" (which at 33+ minutes takes up most of Disc One).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But his electric guitar, even lacking the familiar distorted frenzy of his first MAHAVISHNU albums, provides rock audiences with an easy point of reference, functioning as an anchor of sorts in the middle of all that exotic Indian instrumentation: tablas and ghatam and bansuri and tanpura. And if those sound more like side dishes at your local Mumbai greasy spoon, maybe you're not quite ready to make the aesthetic leap from a mere 7-minute Carl Palmer drum solo to a 28-minute (!) percussion duet performed in large part on something resembling an earthenware jug.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I'm no judge of tabla virtuosity, but I will say these discs contain some of John McLaughlin's fastest and yet most fluid guitar runs, no small claim for an artist of his caliber. And yet even at its most frenetic (and there are moments when the hands of each musician must have been simply a transparent blur on stage) there's always an air of meditative calm and grace surrounding the entire album, a sharing of musical space and spirit all but unheard of in other musical arenas.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Clearly this was not a concert about egos, but about cooperation and trust. And if you extend the same courtesy to listening to the CD itself, it will reward you more than you can imagine.
