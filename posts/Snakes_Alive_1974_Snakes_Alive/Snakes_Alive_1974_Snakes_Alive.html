  Australian band SNAKES ALIVE was a short-lived band project consisting of Michael Vidale (bass), Peter Nykyruj (drums), Alex Ditrich (keyboards), Boris Peric (guitars), Jonas Thomas (sax, flute, vocals) and Colin Campbell (trumpet). Their sole album was recorded and privately released in a limited number of copies back in 1974, and have never seen an official label release nor a legit CD reissue

  Did not think we'd ever see this one. This was an album released as a demo in a quantity of 50 without a cover. It's mainly known due to its presence online, and someone later had appended a cover. This new CD reissue is maintaining the cover (not sure of the source of the artwork honestly) and is adding one bonus track. Here's what the label says (using Google Translate): "A work that was recorded as an item in the collector as an Ultra / Rare item that was recorded in Australia in 1975 and that only 50 test presses exist. There used to be a small number of pirate CD - R boards of this board - raising before, but this time it is the first regular board using the master taken from the master tape. Like Australia, it is a masterpiece on which a thrilling jazz rock sound with saxophone, flute, trumpet etc added to it. Release on paper jacket, SHM-CD!"

   In the early 70s, the music world was teeming with jazz fusion bands. The major two schools were a) The technically proficient, as defined by the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever and Weather Report. And b) The Miles Davis long track deep groove, with many followers in Germany (in particular the MPS label), Poland, Italy, USA and beyond. These were jazzers who were fascinated with rock's rhythms and power. But finding rockers who were fascinated by jazz was a much more rare breed. And that's why they call it jazz fusion. Snakes Alive are a rock fusion band. Of course bands like Mahavishnu come to mind. Even early Zappa and Xhol Caravan. But, you know, Finch did too - for example. There are vocals, but they're sparse. Trumpet, sax, flute, organ, guitar are the solo instruments. And it rocks with a capital R. This is a good one, that's slipped way under the radar.

   Apparently this quite forgotten Australian album was never officially released. There were just these 50 private pressing copies made. And there isn't a vinyl reissue yet so if you want to get this one to your record shelf it's a pretty hard (maybe even impossible) task unless you're rich. It seems like there aren't even any unofficial bootlegs available which is pretty odd.

   On the musical point of view this record offers some nice jazz-rock with progressive rock influences. The instrumental work is solid and in some points the guitar sounds very impressive. However I don't like the fact that the album includes horns. Luckily they're not dominating the overall sound but I still could do without them just fine.

   If you're interested in jazz-rock, jazz-fusion or jazzy prog rock you might wanna check out this incredibly rare album.
