   Sometimes the easiest way to get "in" to someone's music is to see how they handle standards. Altoist Arthur Blythe, who -- although he has been associated somewhat with the avant-garde -- does not fit easily into any category, is heard on this 1978 studio session exploring four veteran songs plus two of his originals. The instrumentation of his quartet is conventional but the musicianship is exceptionally high (pianist Stanley Cowell, bassist Fred Hopkins, and drummer Steve McCall), and it is quite interesting to hear how they stretch such songs as "In a Sentimental Mood,""Jitterbug Waltz," and "Caravan," making them sound fresh and original.

   “I would love for everyone to accept my music, and I would love to make money, but only by keeping my music on the cutting edge,” Here Blythe is working with pianist Stanley Cowell, bassist Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall on drums. One look at the pieces, two by Ellington, one by Fats Waller, one by Coltrane and the rest by Blythe, you can see there is an effort to ameliorate the avant-garde reputation of Blythe. ‘In A Sentimental Mood’ was occasionally played by Paul Gonsalves and Johnny Hodges, Blythe brings a different sensibility to the music.  He does not caress the melody in the way that the Ellingtonians would.  The interpretation is wilder, passionate and more strident. Stanley Cowell also enjoys embellishing ‘Caravan’ before Blythe soars away emotionally into a blizzard of notes.
