   Rarely on eBay and extremely hard to find, Milton Wright's 2nd album 'Spaced' is an ultra-rare LP that soul and rare groove collectors often talk about - but never get to hear. Recorded by the same enigmatic soul singer who gave us the immortal club classic 'Keep it Up', the album 'Spaced' was overlooked by his record company and the public because it was released just as superstar status was dawning on fellow label mates KC &amp; the Sunshine Band. Overshadowed by the ensuing fame of their sidekicks, the album was suspended in a commercial no man's land. Adding insult to injury, the piles of unsold copies were subsequently destroyed in a warehouse fire.

   A few copies escaped the flames, and a few intrepid collectors have managed to track them down. Those lucky enough to hear one have been astounded that such a quality album of beautiful, soulful music has been allowed to remain unheard and unloved for so long.

   This is the second release in Jazzman's Holy Grail reissue series, featuring those super-ultra, rarest-of-the-rare albums that everyone wants, but nobody can find. Rarely on eBay and extremely hard to find, Milton Wright's second album, 1977's Spaced is an ultra-rare LP that soul and rare groove collectors often talk about but never get to hear. Recorded by the same enigmatic soul singer who gave us the immortal club classic "Keep it Up," this album was overlooked by his record company and the public because it was released just as superstar status was dawning on fellow label mates KC &amp; The Sunshine Band. Overshadowed by the ensuing fame of their sidekicks, the album was suspended in a commercial no-man's-land. Adding insult to injury, the piles of unsold copies were subsequently destroyed in a warehouse fire. A few copies escaped the flames, and a few intrepid collectors have managed to track them down. Those lucky enough to hear one have been astounded that such a quality album of beautiful, soulful music has been allowed to remain unheard and unloved for so long. Unbelievably meticulous funk/soul, with an effortless, mellow vibe. All songs never-before reissued -- previously only available as a highly-collectable LP valued at well over $1,000. Fully licensed and restored from original sources. Housed in the original album artwork in a package that includes a 4-page color booklet with in-depth liner notes from original interviews with previously-unpublished photographs.
