   I saw this album being mentioned by several people as I was lurking around RYM for psychedelic-folk recommendations, so I decided to check it out. As the opening track rolled along, I thought to myself, “Boy, this sure sounds a lot like the stuff my parents would play when others were around so everyone could laugh at my screaming.“ Yet, I found myself immediately captivated and wanting more. Perhaps it was because I had become more mature and open to music that the “cool” kids I wanted to be like in the past weren’t listening to. Or maybe it’s simply because this album has enough pulling power to attract those normally repelled by this type of music. But whatever the case, Mother Sky has become one of my most-rotated albums.

   Perhaps the album’s highlight is Douji Morita’s excellent songwriting ability. The songs sound ordinary on the surface like most pop music, but they don’t try to force an impression onto the listener. This gives the album a natural, composed atmosphere that makes it accessible to listeners of all ages while leaving plenty of room for depth and even a little experimentation. And sure enough, Douji Morita fills up that depth with all the emotion she can fit in. When a song is supposed to be sad, melancholy floods the room. And when a song is supposed to be soothing, the listener is instantly pacified. A good example of this would be ぼくたちの失敗 (Bokutachi No Shippai), the album’s opener. Using a soft piano, lush violin accompaniment, and Douji Morita’s voice, the song creates a natural, calming atmosphere that naturally radiates calmness. Unfortunately, I don’t know Japanese very well, so I can’t make any judgment on the lyrics. I will say, though, that you don’t need to understand them to enjoy the music.

   The musicianship is great as well. Douji Morita’s collected and unassuming voice is perfect for this kind of melancholic, emotion-oriented folk, and she utilizes that voice in a very natural manner. All of the instruments utilized fit in with the atmosphere perfectly and add to it as opposed to simply just being there. There are no awkward moments where an instrument is fumbling over what it is supposed to be doing or whether it is even supposed to be there. Rather, everything is carefully laid out such that all the instruments work together in harmony.

   To sum it up, Mother Sky is an amazing listen and an exemplary example of psychedelic folk. The album twists the general drugged-out mood of psychedelic folk, adding chamber folk, baroque pop, and older Japanese pop into the mix to create a melancholic album filled to the brim with emotion. Casual music listeners and music geeks alike will almost certainly find something to take away from this album.
