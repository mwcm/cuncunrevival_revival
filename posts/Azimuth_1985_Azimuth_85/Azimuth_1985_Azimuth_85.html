   The equivocal trio known as Azimuth will forever be one of ECM’s most profound. The combination of John Taylor’s pianism and Norma Winstone’s vocals alongside Kenny Wheeler’s soulful trumpeting was just what the 1980s needed to find solace in sound. Taylor’s heart is sure to still yours in “Adios Iony,” from which Wheeler and Winstone draw parallel threads before the slow persuasion of words begins to make itself heard:

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   …a boat rounds the bend…bearing down…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   breathtaking…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   three herons stand their ground…swaying…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   did you see them land?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   moon behind branches…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   suddenly bright, clear, frosty
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Winstone paints her poetry in talk-singing before leaping into a pool of organ as Wheeler plays us out. “Dream” sleeps peacefully in loving vocal arms.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   you and I in a vast deserted square
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   everything crumbles to the ground
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   facing you, I slowly slide into the chasm of your smile…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   We feel blissfully lost, somehow grounded by love yet pushed ever forward beyond our wildest desires and into humbler shelters. The piano of “Lost Song” then looks us in the eye as if to speak the next title: “Who Are You?” The trumpeting here is liquid mercury. Like Siegfried’s bird, it is a floating commentator, hanging from the thinnest of threads pinched in forested fingers.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   …funny to think of the children we were
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   memories we walked right through
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   but now you ask,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   I’d have to guess that you feel lonely too…
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Music and song walk hand in hand into the slow dance that follows. In “Breathtaking,” Winstone touches glaring heights with her vast internal power, drawing her throat into the refractions of a “February Daze.” The Steve Reichian consistency in the keys lends unusual urgency to the group’s ethereal sound, which only further blurs the snapshot rendered in “Til Bakeblikk.” The album’s elixir is made complete with two “Potions,” the second of which sits perched on the softly swinging bar of its aural cage, forever singing, forever wanting, and finding flight only in the concluding silence.

   This is Azimuth’s zenith and another significant chapter of ECM’s backstory. It’s easy to see why this album never made it on to the 3-disc retrospective, for to do so would have risked diluting its value as a standalone artifact. Essential for many reasons, not least of all for Taylor, who plays as if he were holding an inanimate body in his hands, tracing its every contour until it comes back to life.
