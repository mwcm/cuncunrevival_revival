  "Live in An American Time Spiral" captures legendary composer, arranger, educator, NEA Jazz Master, and 'MacArthur Fellow' George Russell, who created the highly-praised and innovative "Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization" music theory, in a live performance by his 14 piece orchestra in NYC circa 1982. With a group of young but well-seasoned rising stars, Russell presents one of his jazz standards, along with the multi-tempo, mercurial "Time Spiral" which was commissioned by the Swedish Radio Broadcasting System and finally the intriguing, atmospheric "DC Divertimento", commissioned by the John F. Kennedy Jazz Festival. And the performances are spectacular, from all aspects of compositions, arrangements, and solos. And the `cham-peen' of the night is one of the best versions ever of Russell's jazz standard composition "Ezz-thetic", written for heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles, featuring blazing, memorable solos from ascendant 'youngsters' Marty Ehrlich on tenor sax, Tom Harrell on trumpet, Ray Anderson on trombone and Victor Lewis on drums, based on a marvelous arrangement by saxophonist/educator Jerry Coker, who 'raises the stakes' near the end with marvelous unison statements and 'trades' between soloists. The soundscape has a 'here-there' feel to it among the orchestra sections with the saxes closer to the mike and the trumpets farther away, but it's acceptable and the solos are on mike in the orchestra. The single track "Ezz-thetic" is worth the price of the CD alone, which is very reasonable. George Russell: one of the great jazz composers and band leaders. My Highest Recommendation.
