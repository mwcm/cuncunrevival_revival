   This live recording is one of several releases based on the private archives of legendary drummer Ginger Baker, which finally see the light of day. Although not intended for a formal release and suffering from "bootleg" sound quality problems, the musical importance of this material is so significant, that it overshadows any technicalities and is essentially a Godsend. This album brings a live recording of Baker's revolutionary Jazz-World Fusion ensemble Air Force, which he founded following the demise of Cream. Air Force recorded only two albums during its short life-span, and any additional material by the band is invaluable. Baker assembled a formidable group of top British Jazz players of the period, augmented by African vocalists and drummers. The fact that this album features the talents of the legendary saxophonist / organist Graham Bond is alone worth the price, but other great players are also present: organist / guitarist Ken Craddock, saxophonist / flautist Steve Gregory, saxophonist Bud Beadle, bassist Colin Gibson and others. The material is similar to the material present on the two Air Force albums, but several surprises are heard here for the first time, like the group's version of Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love". Most of the pieces include extended improvised parts, with the saxophonist taking solos in tandem. Definitely worth investigating, provided you're not squeamish about sound quality.

   Well, the liner notes are honest. This is a true bootleg-probably some stoner standing with his tape deck held high over his head. This is a good performance overall, but if you're looking for instrument separation and clear vocals, I'd probably have you take a pass on this. This is not the band line-up that recorded the GB Air Force record in '70. Winwood &amp; Gretch (his Blind faith partners) are both absent. This is a very raw recording. For die-hards, I'd say pick-up a copy. It is a solid performance. My only issue is the sound quality. As a side note, the price was fair and there's a lot of music for your buck over 2 discs with plenty of jamming. You be your own judge. I'm just offering a heads-up for any audiophiles out there thinking about it.
