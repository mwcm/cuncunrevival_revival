  This is one of a pair of concert recordings from the reconvened Faust of the early 90s, featuring the trio of founder members Hans- Joachim Irmler, Jean Herve Peron and Zappi Diemaier. I didn't see any performances by this particular incarnation, but having seen Faust live on more than one occasion I know just how powerful they can be on stage and how well they can reinterpret their studio work.
  <br/>
  Unfortunately, this limited edition release doesn't really do them justice. The bootleg level sound quality doesn't help; vocals and drums tend to drown out everything else a lot of the time. Also, Faust's studio albums are painstakingly assembled sonic events, whilst onstage they add a strong visual and theatrical dimension to their work. The use of power tools is very effective in a live context, but on CD you just get to hear the sounds of chainsaws and angle grinders over Zappi Diemaier's muscular drumming. This is a pity, as there are some interesting ideas audible here and there - Gorecki's Symphony No 3 comes in for a mauling (which would become one of the most effective tracks on Rien, itself based on live recordings from a US tour) and a Beethoven piano sonata underpins an eccentric version of It's a Rainy Day Sunshine Girl.

  This was a very limited edition which occasionally surfaces on ebay or in second hand shops at inflated prices. If you saw them on that particular tour it's a nice souvenir, but otherwise it's definitely one for completists and diehard fans only.
