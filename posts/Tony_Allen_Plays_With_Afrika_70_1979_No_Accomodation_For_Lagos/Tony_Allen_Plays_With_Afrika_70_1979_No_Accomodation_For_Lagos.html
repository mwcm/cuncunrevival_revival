   I am drawn more and more to the afrobeat sound...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There is more to this record than there might at first seem. When I first listened to it I was a little overwhelmed by the length of the songs and their seemingly repetitive nature. However, all my initial reservations were thrown aside as I found myself increasingly drawn in to the music. My reluctant Western ears have opened up to the power of the funk influenced, but still African, bass lines and drum grooves and to the horns which accent these relentless groooves with an exciting energy. Tony Allen's vocals are deep and funky and compliment the strong musical rhythm. The content of the lyrics ranges from political and social commentary to the music itself and so give the listener good insight into life in Lagos at the time. This record is definately worth checking out, it has a great vibe, and should get better the more it is played.

   This album is like the duke ellington leading the jb horns or earth, wind and fire's phenix horns in a sunday evening jam session... imagine parliament-funkadelic in the hands of miles davis and you kinda get somewhat of a feel for what i'm saying...

   or better yet, if you like grover washington or some idris muhammad, then you'll most definitely enjoy this as well...

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Go ahead, give this a try yall... traditional jazz fans and smooth jazz fans can probably both find some satisfaction in this sound.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   i hope you enjoy it!
