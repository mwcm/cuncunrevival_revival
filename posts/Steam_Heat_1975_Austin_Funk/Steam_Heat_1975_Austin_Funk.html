    A legendary album from the Texas scene of the 70s – exactly the kind of set that helps the city of Austin live up to its massive reputation for music! The group's got a wonderful blend of jazz, soul, and funk – a unique blend that reminds us of our favorite funky Fantasy Records sides from the Bay Area scene, but which is even more special here as a standout set from Austin. Like some of the best ensemble funk sets of the 70s, the groove's choppy one minute, jazzy the next – really drawing from the many spirits that inhabit the 8-piece lineup, in ways that really let everyone's talents sparkle. Drums are nice and tight, and the keyboard and saxophone work is wonderful too –

   In the 1970s when cowboys were cosmic, Austin Funk was an unlikely word pairing. In the heart of outlaw country, funk renegades Steam Heat packed dance floors at the Armadillo World Headquarters and Soap Creek Saloon with Tower of Power-styled grooves. The eightpiece released its lone LP in 1975 before undergoing an Extreme Heat makeover two years later. The reissue of Austin Funk comes at a time when the 1,000 or so original pressings fetch big bucks online. The group's jazz foundation flourishes on the bopping fusion of "Body Talk" and "Frozen Tundra Lady," while slinky bouncer "Funk 'n' Roll" shows off the dynamic interplay between frontmen Bruce Spelman and Phil Ritcherson. Swanky time portals "Groove Awhile" and "Since I Met You" have a shag-carpet-on-the-ceiling vibe, Steam Heat boiling over on smoking funk dynamos "Radiator" and "Ghetto Tool," a pair of tunes that prove Austin Funk is no oxymoron.
