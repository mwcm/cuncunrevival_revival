   Part of MPS’s groundbreaking ‘Jazz Meets the World’ series, this 1967 album combines the Basel Carnival tambour and jazz drumming traditions. The Basel tambour band of Alfred Sacher and Georges Mathys’ assemblage of top fife players join up with four internationally renowned Swiss jazz drummers. Presiding over the gathering: pianist-composer-arranger George Gruntz, ‘the perfect mediator’. Sacher’s drum corps lead off with the traditional march D’Reemer (the Romans), a piece whose origins are shrouded in the mist of time. Composed by Gruntz, the title piece introduces the four Swiss jazz drummers. The theme integrates tambour and jazz drum traditions before the four solos – Charlie Antolini professes the swing style of Buddy Rich, Daniel Humair exhibits his ‘melodic’ approach, Pierre Favre shows restraint and a love of symbol colors, and Mani Neumeier takes an eclectic multi-perussion path. The next section features an Antolini-Favre duo followed by Neumeier-Humair. Then there’s Humair disassembling his drum set, a climactic quartet duel, and back to the tambour style. Hightime Keepsakes features Gruntz’s quintet with Favre on drums. The piece runs through a series of motifs and features Nathan Davis’ stunning soprano sax solo. On Intercourse, jazz and the drum corps converse, with the tambour drums trading places with Antolini halfway through each of the bass, trumpet, and sax solos, while on Change of Air the Basel fifers play together with Humair and the jazz rhythm section. Based on lanquenet Marches from the 1499 Swabian War, Gruntz’s Sketches for Percussion exploits the myriad percussive possibilities by combining the tambour and jazz drummers in various groupings. Retraite Celeste (Heavenly Retreat) ends the album in a folkloric tour de force, as the full jazz ensemble along with the Basel drummers and fifers create a finely woven asymmetric percussive tapestry. Joachim E. Berendt captured the album’s importance: “The musical breath of the times swings in records such as these.”

   I was looking for this album, because Gruntz's "Noon in Tunisia" from the same year is such an interesting and good work. The original title is "Drums and Folklore: From Sticksland with Love". The concert happened in the Stadttheater in Basel. Involved in this very percussive experiment, sponsored by SABA, are two swiss carnival-bands, "Alfred Sacher's drum clique" and "George Mathy's five corps", which have a lot of space to do their things, together with George Gruntz - piano, Nathan Davis - sax, Franco Ambrosetti - trumpet, Jimmy Woode - bass and the four drummers Charly Antolini, Pierre Favre, Daniel Humair and the later Guru Guru Elektrolurch-spacecadet Mani Neumeier.

   Before it comes to the mixing experiment, which, compared to the experience of "Noon in Tunisia", isn't as spectacular as one could hope, the concert starts with drumming and drumming and drumming, as the album title implied. The "Folklore" is sometimes near to military march rhytms. On the other side, their are a lot of traditional folklore streetbands, knowbody would have the idea to dance to, it's just for walking along and maybe whistle some melodies. I must say I was astonished about the enthusiastic ovations by the audience in the pauses of the (technically good) drumming. I had to wait patiently for the more interesting parts, where the jazzband is more in the forground. But, as I mentioned above, it didn't had the effect, that makes "Noon in Tunisia" so unique. And sadly for my taste the jazzier parts with this interesting musicians are a little bit too short.

   Don't get me wrong, all the playing is surely good in a technical way. But this sponsored experiment isn't able to touch my soul. So it's really difficult to score this album. Because this concert was an unusual idea and the jazz players are really good,
