  Liner Notes from 1973 re-issue:
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Once in a lifetime a talent appears who bears the stamp of greatness. A talent so impregnated with intensity that the potential is immediately unmistakable. So is the proficient artistry of Billy Preston.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Billy is one of the most respected organists in gospeldom, as well as pop circles. Since his youth, Billy's work with choirs and group, both in person and on recordings, has been exeptionally original.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On this gospel album, Billy Preston displays his talents as both an organist and a pianist, and through the mechanical magic of overdubbing he may be heard playing both instruments simultaneously. Especially interesting is Billy's rendition of the old Hymn PASS ME NOT O GENTLE SAVIOR. The Hymns, for the most part are standard and his interpretation of them, though performed in unique Preston manner, retain much of the basic quality. In other words, you can sing along with the organ and piano and you can identify each and every selection.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Such old favorites as WHEN I LAY MY BURDEN DOWN, HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW, JUST A CLOSER WALK WITH THEE and ANGELS KEEP WATCHING OVER ME are included with more recent popular items as HOW GREAT THOU ART and THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE. And for an appreciation of Billy's versatility, listen to him as he makes his electric console organ speak in the traditional cathedral style on PREAISE GOD FROM WHOM ALL BLESSINGS FLOW.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Though Billy has received many awards, including a GRAMMY for his popular soul recordings, it is apparent his roots are in Gospel and this album presents Billy to the audience with the Gospel of his soul in it's purest form.
