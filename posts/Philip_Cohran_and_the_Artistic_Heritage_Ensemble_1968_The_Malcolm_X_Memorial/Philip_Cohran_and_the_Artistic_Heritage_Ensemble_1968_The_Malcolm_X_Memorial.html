   [Note: The Mississippi Records vinyl reissue unfortunately, and erroneously, reverses the Side order: Side A features 1) "Malcolm X" and 2) "El Hajj Malik El Shabazz; Side B features 1) "Malcolm Little" and 2) "Detroit Red."  If you get this version, make sure you play Side B first to preserve the intended track sequence.]

   The Malcolm X Memorial is a live album of four long tracks that pay tribute to four parts of Malcolm X’s life. As I could never have the understanding of what, plus I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful with my modern day take, I’ve copied identically the text from the back cover explaining the motivation behind each of the pieces of music.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Malcolm Little” – the first song or stage is “Malcolm Little” which represents Malcolm as a little boy, quite helpless but with good eyes to see and a clear memory. This stage is identical with the condition of Black people when they were brought to America against their will.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Detroit Red” – was the second stage which represented escape through pleasure and forgetting the past. Many Black Americans are still in this stage of dope, alcohol, self-abuse, and refusal to deal with the problem.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Malcolm X” – is the awakening and embracing of Black values as the result of Mr. Elijah Muhammad’s teaching. This combination was heard around the world and gave many Blacks a choice of ways to live.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “El Hajj Malik El Shabazz” – was the pinnacle of Malcolm’s Development. Through his pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm returned to his Asiatic homeland. If focused international attention on the Black American’s struggle for a separate way of life.

   “Malcolm Little” is more of a blues based piece that has the hopeful feel of childhood and innocence. This piece starts with the raw blues feel, but then picks up pace with the inclusion of the Tuba that adds the bouncy hopeful feel, and the highlight of the piece a beautiful flute solo from Eugene Easton. There’s a very pastoral feel to this piece that has a wonderful positivity to it.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Detroit Red” has a big-band swing feel and represents the lindy hopping zoot suit wearing part of Malcolm X’s life, or as the cover says his hedonistic period.  Musically this piece has a slow, but forceful pace that has a real film soundtrack quality to it. What adds the more contemporary feel is the heavy percussion and an excellent tenor solo by Eugene Easton. You can hear a bit of a Sun Ra influence in this piece.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Malcolm X” is a chant piece that does not pull it’s punches in telling the white man he’s no good. This is probably the most forceful piece, and once again has a real early Sun Ra feel.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The last piece is “El Hajj Malik El Shabazz” which represents his shift from the Nation Of Islam to more spiritual teachings. This piece has a real Eastern feel to it and has some similarity to the Mulatu Astatke albums that were recently reissued. There’s two pieces to this tune, the first having an up-tempo percussive busy feel, which is meant to represent the Eastern market place, and in the second there is heavy use of Trap drums to represent the confusion in the hall where Malcolm X was assassinated followed with a vocal tribute to the “ultimate meaning of Malcolm’s sacrifice:  IMMORTALITY”.

   Like Philip Cohran &amp; The Artistic Heritage Ensemble’s other album On the Beach this is an incredible musical experience. As far as I know this outfit only made two albums, and those albums are two of the finest blues/jazz explorations I’ve ever heard; both are five star essentials. Also, on this CD reissue they have not used those awful plastic gel cases, the cover art is a miniature representation of the original cover. In fact I think they must have used the image from an original cover as there is yellowing and the mark where the vinyl has been.

   The quality of this album is not immediately apparent: it creeps up on the listener.  Cohran and his Artistic Heritage Ensemble follow up the excellent On the Beach with a live suite that pays homage to the novelistic arc of Malcolm X's extraordinary life.  Each distinct phase of it is charted musically here. As with the previous album, Cohran's music is difficult to pin down: it incorporates obvious elements of African music and American jazz, but it also draws on rock, blues (the album begins with a bluesy intro by future Miles Davis guitarist Pete Cosey), and Euro-classical song structure.  In addition to the superb, seamless instrumentation here, the ambience of the room (recorded at the Affro-Arts Theater on February 25, 1968 in Chicago) makes the recording sound like a lost document, a bootleg, a piece of our musical heritage that we weren't supposed to hear.  Usually I'm not a big fan of jazz suites (Mingus's highly regarding The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady bores me to tears and Coltrane's A Love Supreme is about my seventh favorite album of his), but this one works quite well, enacting young Malcolm Little's turbulent younger years, his exciting but dangerous years as Detroit Red in Boston and New York City, his conversion to the spirituality espoused by The Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam as Malcolm X, and, lastly, his more general and multicultural embrace of Islam as El Hajj Malik El Shabazz.  This set is for fans of jazz, and great music in general, whether they revere Malcolm X or detest him.
