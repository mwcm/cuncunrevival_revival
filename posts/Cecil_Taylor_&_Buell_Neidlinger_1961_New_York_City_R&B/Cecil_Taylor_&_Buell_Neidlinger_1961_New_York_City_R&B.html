   Hmmm some interesting things to hear. It's amazing to hear the session was completed in two days, because the tunes (and let's say the concept behind the tracks) are so different. Of course Cecil's playing is always there, but i could have easily believed this was a compilation of works done over years. Maybe the shifting personnel enhances this impression of mine. It starts with Neidlinger and Higgins (d) laying a solid background for Cecil's free playing. 'Cell Walk for Celeste' features Archie Shepp in a composition of Taylor, wich is clearly arranged but still in a very free form. Side two opens with a trio's free improvisation. And at the end there's again Shepp and an even bigger horn section with Clark Terry, Steve Lacey and Roswell Rudd playing the Ellington tune 'Things Ain't What they Used to Be'. I really like this tune. A swinging tune yet enriched with some modern ideas. Can't help of thinking on Monk at times listening to Taylor's playing. All in all it's not exactly my favourite lp, but worth listening to from time to time at the very least.
