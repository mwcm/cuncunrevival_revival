   In the early 1970s, avant garde jazz did a similar thing as rock music and sought to reinvent itself though pieces for increasingly large ensembles. The results were sometimes impressive, but more often slightly embarrassing.

   Echoes of Prayer is an ambitious free jazz symphony composed by Moncur for Carla Bley's Jazz Composers Orchestra. Moncur has always been a proficient composer, but up to this point his pieces had mostly been for much smaller ensembles. While he was familiar with the textures that result from simultaneous group improvisation through his work with Alan Silva, Dave Burrell and Archie Shepp, composing a multi-layered texture like this was in some ways a first.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The result is perhaps a bit overwhelming on the first listen, more than Burrell's and Silva's walls of noise actually, because there seems to be so much going on at every corner of this music, which is really more like a collage of pieces glued together. There is definitely some good stuff in this, even though it may take a while to find it as the arrangements are big and the music is not really accessible. If it has a weakness, it's probably that sometimes the score seems to be uncertain about where it's heading and if it's really coherent; fortunately these sections are usually followed by other section with a very strong sense of direction and coherence.

   Definitely Moncur's most abstract work, miles away from his 1960s records. Complex, but still very rewarding.
