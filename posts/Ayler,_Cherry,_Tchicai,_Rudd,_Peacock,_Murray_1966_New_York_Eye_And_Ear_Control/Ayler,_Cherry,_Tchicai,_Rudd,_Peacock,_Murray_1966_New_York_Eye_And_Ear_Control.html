   This is a very interesting set, music that was freely improvised and used as the soundtrack for the 34-minute short film New York Eye and Ear Control. Tenor saxophonist Albert Ayler leads the all-star sextet (which also includes trumpeter Don Cherry, altoist John Tchicai, trombonist Roswell Rudd, bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray) on two lengthy jams. The music is fiery but with enough colorful moments to hold one's interest throughout.

   What's alarming about this record is not how free &amp; disjointed everything sounds - that's expected w/ the likes of Murray, Ayler, Rudd, Cherry, &amp; Peacock - but how cohesive and coherent it all is. This is the sound of six incredible musicians tearing it all apart and carefully - musically, melodically - putting it all back together again.

   Each of the six contributors to this piece are at the peak of their exploratory powers. Ayler is not as screechy and central as usual, and the rhythm section of Peacock and Murray keeps things sufficiently elastic so that the horns can have a conversation. The most interesting thing about the album is how it appears to lack one individual's overarching vision. Though the blueprint of Albert Ayler's recordings is all over this, none of his albums as a bandleader sound quite like this (except for maybe Bells). The "fire music" Ayler is known for is, to a certain extent, absent here in favor of the more intellectually driven free jazz of, say, Bill Dixon and the AACM movement. Regardless, lovers of experimental jazz will find plenty to love about this exciting ESP-Disk release.
