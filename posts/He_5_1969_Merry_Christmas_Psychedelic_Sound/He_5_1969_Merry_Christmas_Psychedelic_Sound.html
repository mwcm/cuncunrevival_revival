   South Korea's He 5, in its later incarnation as He 6, offered some of the fuzziest, funkiest music to arise from Seoul's Psychedelic '70s. In "Merry Christmas Psychedelic Album" (Universal South Korea "THL-80") there are all Christmas songs, done in an instrumental, Garagey-Psychedelic fashion. But their cover of "Jingle Bells" morphs, about a minute and a half into the track, into a ten minute freak out cover of "In A Gadda Da Vida" and, after the drum break, wails into "Paint It Black".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He5 and He6 is a group from great Korean Rock guitarist "Kim Hong Tak". They were the most popular Korean Rock group at 1960-1970s. They played heavy and hard Psychedelic songs on live shows but they couldn't make this music style on albums because of record company's pressures. They gave them some discretionary power to have them created the results which they had on He5: "Merry Christmas Psychedelic Album" and He6 "Would you Go Go dance" with He6 "Vol.1" and "Vol.2" but most their fans couldn't understand the tracks of these albums so they were forced to change to a more popular music style.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Kim Hong-Tak (1944~) was one of the 2 leading figures in the early days of "Group Sound Era", of course with Shin Joong-Hyun(1938~).  Kim Hong Tak was guitarist and naturally leader of the group. Here, it seems better to put aside the question " Who was the first?". Because with this question of 'the first' or more properly 'the Origin', the ansters will not is the same according to the questioner's perspectives. For example, if we take one perspective, in this case that of 'Popularity', it will be the Key Boys of Kim Hong Tak which was followed soon afterwards by the Add4 of Shin Joong-Hyun.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A little remark. This Key Boys is not the 'Later' Key Boys who sang the smash hits like "Let's go to the seashore". or "Memories of the seaside", but the 'Earlier' Keyboys. They played some 'Package shows', under the name of the Lock &amp; Key in the stages of the 8 th U.S army which settled in South Korea. Also they played at some new venues like 'Music listen Rooms', 'Live Music Salons', or the traditional ones like in Cinema.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With these latter acts they were known to general 'Korean' public. They were nicknamed as the 'Beatles of Korea' - At that time this meant more similar to a 'cover band of the Beatles'.. (Cf. Because the stages in 8th Army of U.S. was for the Korean in the forbidden area for the evident reason of security. So generally a Korean group or artist who played there was a totally unknown figure to general Korean public).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the mid-60s which prevailed by the worldwide phenomenon ' Beatlesmanis', the Key Boys, in molding the archetype of the Rock band (or Rock Group) who 'sing and play' (With the Kkokkirri Brothers, the Fools, the Kim Chies, became the pioneers of a new cultural phenomenon (we may now be able to say that it was the early days of 'Pop culture' in Korea). And here lies one symbolic fact concerning the popular culture in general that 1964-1965, the period of their debuts coincides with that of the birth of the 'Weekly Magazine'. With the time, the members of the Key Boys left the group: some Cha Jung Rak and Cha Do Gyun going to solos, some Yoon Hang Ki joining to the Korean Army's entertainment Unit which was sent to the Viet-Nam War, and finally Kim Hong Tak too.  But Kim Hong Tak had launched his career of guitarist in a rock group. It was the He 5.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Precisely speaking, the He5 was not launched by Kim hong Tak. According to the memories of its members, the group was found in the winter of 1967 'the five young guys' all belonged to the Wha-Yange Entertainment Inc. had set up the group together; Han Woong (Rhythm guitar and vocal) issued from the Four Guys, Cho Yong Nam (lead guitar and vocal) from the Shin Jung Hyun and the Jokers, Yu Young Chun (vocal) from the Silver Coins, Han Kwang Soo (Bass) from the Kee Jin Sung's Orchestra. For the connoisseurs, they were all 'top-class' musicians from the leading groups of that time.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And in this period Kim Hong Tak was still in the Key Boys. (Cf. Wha-Yang Entertainment Inc. was one of the enterprises who dealt wht matters concerning the distribution of musicians and entertainers for the 8th Army of USA.- tiwh the Universal, Dae-Young,Dong IL).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The He 5 begins tis gigs at the Seven Club in I-Tae-Won (a small quarter of Seoul which is now well know even internationally for its diverse markets, restaurants and bars mainly for the foreign customers. This quarter was the bassist Han Kwang Soo soon afterwards was a challenge for the He5. Kim Hong Tak was recruited as a lead guitarist (So-called 'first guitarist' at that time) and Cho Yong Nam, the original lead guitarist of the band changes his speciality to bass guitar. The joining of Kim Hong Tak not only strengthens the group's musical forces but also gives the occasion to the group of presenting themselves to 'general Korean public'. So ends a 'Boy' period of Key Boys, comes a new era of the 'He'."

At least they had their chances to make some albums with the music style they wanted after they became the famous rock group."
