   It's hard to believe there is a musician anywhere on this earth that could mix great jazz chops with a soulful outlook and a worldly attitude and still make it so fun and funky that it doesn't matter what allegiance you address. This stuff rocks. And, amazingly, it's just as timely now as it was back then.

   The following tunes come from Manu Dibango's Africadelic album, the tremendous 1973 French-only follow-up of sorts to the worldwide smash that was “Soul Makossa." Copies of this LP, which was briefly issued on CD about a decade ago, can still be found (and, surprisingly, the LP is actually easier and cheaper to get a hold of than the CD).

   Several folks have posted samples of the music from this album on YouTube, which I am only too pleased to share here.

   I've been a big fan of Cameroon's greatest living musician since Manu Dibango's classic “Soul Makossa" in 1972—which surely everybody in the free world knows by now (it's influenced much music, including, most notably, Michael Jackson's 1983 hit “Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'").

   But I was convinced by Electric Africa (1985) and fully converted by Wakafrika (1994). Africadelic is just one of the hidden gems in Manu DiBango's capacious catalog. Here are examples of why it's so good:

   This album has some funky grooves and its kind of Santana like in places, like, on 'African Battle'. The percussion and organs no matter what country, when they get funky, well, they sound Santana like, and the Afro on this album has latin flavours and is quite percussive. This is an all instrumental album, uneven but good. Some tracks totally outshine others, but I think more than anything it is the song composition on some, not the funky horns, searing guitar, excellent percussion, or other instruments, they are really good. Some really nice flute and vibes on 'Oriental Sunset'. The album was composed and recorded in the span of one week by Manu Dibango, after the success of 'Soul Mokossa', maybe it was rushed, or Dibango had so much music bursting out of him, he had to get it out, lay it down. But really, no complaints here, I just played it five times in a row,,, must be good.
