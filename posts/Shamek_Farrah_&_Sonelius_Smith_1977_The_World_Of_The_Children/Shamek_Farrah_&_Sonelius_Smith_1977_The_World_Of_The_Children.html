   Another great session of spiritual soul jazz and one of the rarest albums on Strata-East from 1976. Shamek Farrah's soulful alto is matched with the free spiritual piano of Sonelius Smith, for a totally memorable session that virtually defines the essence of the Strata East sound. The music is free, but not too free; lyrical, but never indulgent; and always turning over with a fresh sense of imagination, and a strident groove that's very much in the classic Strata East mode.

   The highlight of this lp is the latin romp of the 10 minute title tune "World Of The Children", a real banger of the first order. David Murray also cut a fantastic version of this with his big band on "South of the Border" which i will post some day.
