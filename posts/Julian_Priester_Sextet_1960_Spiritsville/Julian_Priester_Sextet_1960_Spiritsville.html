   The 1960 album Spiritsville marked the leader debut of trombonist Julian Priester on record. Blessed with a fluent technique, a stirringly deep-down sound and a light, sure tone, he was a commanding soloist with unfailing swing and ideas. But he also stood out as a jazz composer with the intriguing ability to always bring fresh ideas to his compositions and an earthy command of the blues. His was a truly unique jazz voice. The main solos of these fine sessions are his, but tenorists Jimmy Heath and Walter Benton, and baritone Charles Davis are also top-table talents in excellent form. Both rhythm sections back them with drive and vivacity, with special emphasis on the stellar pianists, particularly Tommy Flanagan, who really stamps his authority on the section. McCoy Tyner's approach is fresh and alert, and he can be as compelling when he comps behind a soloist as when he plays solo himself. The results were two warm, unpretentious small group dates that still seem timeless and fresh.
