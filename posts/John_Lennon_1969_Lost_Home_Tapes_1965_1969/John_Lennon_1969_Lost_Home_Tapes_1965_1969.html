   Well….here’s one you absolutely need!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   John Lennon’s Beatles era Home Demos updated and revised to include new and lengthened home demos from 1965–1969. Kudos to Misterclaudel for releasing to the collector new and expanded demo tracks we’ve only read about in Sulpy’s “Guide” book.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The problem here is the enjoyability factor….or lack of. It’s a tough CD to sit through compared to the latest home demo set John Lennon At Home from the His Master’s Choice Label. This set does have two new items that are pleasant and bearable. One track called “Hold On I’m Coming” which is no more than a sketch of an idea that John abandoned and a misplaced yet pleasant “Mr. Moonlight” that post-dates this era. Complete with typing in the background. The rest are made up of new to bootleg stoned out mellotron experiments, John’s attempts at comedy and extended demos that are incomplete workouts. Sound quality is just above bearable on most of these tracks. I was only able to sit through most of these once. At times, once was more than enough. The rest are familiar to collectors. Some are extended, but the sound quality is no better than previous shortened versions that have been available. They’ve even sourced some tracks from old bootleg vinyl! I was also hoping for the inclusion of other home demos, such as the previously released (on bootleg) “I’m In Love”, to round it out.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Disc one is the hardest to sit through in terms of listenability, quality but it’s where you’ll find “Hold On I’m Coming” and “Mr. Moonlight” Otherwise, most of it’s hard to tolerate in one sitting. The second disc has some interest and contains more fleshed out ideas. These are more like the working tapes we’ve become used to from his post-Beatles home demos and “Julia and bits of “Oh My Love”(that contains new to bootleg expanded tracks — but you’ll skip through the Yoko part believe me. Thank god for this song having lots hiss!) and Don’t Let Me Down” perked me up. (Track lists below)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Historically, this set puts the working mind of John Lennon during his psychedelic Beatles years into a historical perspective, but it also shows how bringing these ideas to fruition, he needed the Beatles as a whole, to become the masterpieces they became.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   14 out of these collective 38 tracks are previously unreleased or longer than previous sources. The sound quality is excellent and the material is both entertaining and compelling.  There are a myriad of choices of exhaustive Lennon sessions out there for the taking including: ‘Archives’ Volumes 1-8 on AZIA Records [JLBUT 0301 – 0308], ‘Lost Lennon Tapes’ Westwood One Broadcasts [wo 001 – 218], ‘The Complete Lost Lennon Tapes’ Vol. 1 – 22 on Walrus Records [Walrus 001 – 36], ‘The Lost Lennon Tapes’ Vol. 01 – 11 on Living Legend [LLRDC 045 – 143], ‘Journals (Part 1) 1968 – 1974’ + ‘Journals (Part 2) 1972 – 1980’ on Cedrem Sound Lab [CD 121-130] just for starters.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   MCCD-123 starts off with the [Private Home Tape] segment featuring short takes of “She Said She Said”. The real pleaser is the extended softer sounding and more romantic “Mr. Moonlight” featuring more of a guitar instrumental. “Mellotrone Music No. 4” + “Mellotron Music No. 5” are the most enjoyable of those sessions that fade gently and lend to an assortment of moods. The smooth vocals for “We Can Work It Out” sound like signature McCartney, surprisingly. The 2:07 minute “Down In Cuba” is simply a scream. Lennon’s satiric sense of humor shines in the 1:06 minute “Pedro The Fisherman”. The 3:28 minute “Chi-Chi’s” offers more Lennon stand-up comedy where he has absolutely gone mad but it is hysterical and totally entertaining. “Stranger In My Arms” sounds like an Elvis parody that shockingly works with Lennon milking it all the way.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   [The “Good Morning, Good Morning” Tape (January – February, 1967)] includes an interesting take of “Good Morning, Good Morning” (track #18). The “Mellotrone Rhythms” + “Mellotrone Drones and Cacophony” pieces sound very similar to “Revolution 9” on the ‘White Album’.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   [The “Cry Baby Cry” Tapes] kicks off with a very interesting 3:00 minute rhythm guitar jam, “Guitar Jam”, mimics portions of Zeppelin’s “White Summer”. The middle to latter part of “Mellotrone Noise and Babbling” + “Noise Redux” are fascinating as Lennon is working through the evolution of “Cry Baby Cry”. It’s raw but powerful and this 6:17 minute track certainly has its moments. “Cry Baby Cry” – “Across The Universe” (track #24) is the most recognizable with Lennon’s lyrical accompaniment and a gem to have due to this extended source.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   MCCD-124 [Private Home Tape] includes a 2:04 minute “You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)”. [The “Julia” Rehearsal Tapes] begin with a precious guitar instrumental of “Julia” that is classic. I don’t believe Lennon was ever able to “match” the effectiveness of his guitar playing when mixing it vocally. On [The “Oh My Love” Rehearsal Tape], “A Case Of the Blues” sounds like “Glass Onion” from the ‘White Album’. The guitar accompaniment for “I’ve Got A Feeling” (track #9) parallels that from “Julia’. You can have the lyrics on “I Want You”. The guitar, however, sounds a bit haunting. The impromptu back + forth lyrical exchanges/banter between John + Yoko reveal Lennon’s more natural gift as a lyricist. Yoko just can’t keep up.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   MCCD-123/124 includes attractive glossy inserts and is housed in a slip case with itemized track listings on the back but no liner notes. The fidelity, once again, is excellent overall and the gain is exceptional.
