    Stone Alliance is a group consisting, most notably, of saxophonist Steve Grossman, bassist Gene Perla, and drummer/percussionist Don Alias. Much like Weather Report, Lifetime, and Return to Forever, Stone Alliance was in the same vein of the "supergroup" trend of the '70s. The Stone Alliance genesis began in 1964 when Gene Perla joined Los Muchachos of Boston, of which Don Alias was a member. Later, in New York City, through their many "loft" rehearsals, they met saxophonist Steve Grossman and, with him, established the first version of Stone Alliance. The trio first recorded together on Grossman's 1973 solo debut Some Shapes to Come. Grossman and Alias had spent much time recording and touring together in Miles Davis' band. The trio released an eponymous album in 1975 (pianist Jan Hammer, who appeared with the trio on Grossman's debut, helped engineer Stone Alliance). It was released on P.M. Records, which Perla founded. The album featured "Sweetie Pie," famously sampled by rap group Original Flavor for their hit "Bowin' Up the Spot." Stone Alliance was known for its blend of Afro-Cuban and funk rhythms with elements of rock and pop, in addition to the often torrent solos from Grossman. The band went on to record four studio albums and release four live albums. Following a European tour, the group broke up but was soon re-formed by Alias and Perla. Other members included keyboardists Mark Gray, Kenny Kirkland, and Kenny Werner, and saxophonists Jerry Bergonzi and Bob Mintzer. After a long hiatus, Stone Alliance reconvened as a trio featuring Alias, Perla, and guitarist Mitch Stein.

    Here’s one that jazz buffs with a predilection for funk and fusion will be delighted to see back in the racks. Until Tidal Waves’ sterling reissue job you’d be hard pressed to get much change from £50 for a scruffy copy of any pressing of Stone Alliance’s 1976 debut. Now it’s rendered pristine and dynamic, all the better to enjoy the dizzying, ants-in-your-pants congo fury of opener Vaya Mulatto as it comes tearing out of your speakers.

    The musicians involved already had quite a pedigree: the percussive powerhouse behind that opening was Don Alias, with Miles Davis’ Bitches Brew and On The Corner under his belt, as well as a stint with the Jaco Pastorius Big Band. He was joined by bassist Gene Perla (best known for his work with Nina Simone) and hard bop sax man Steve Grossman, who had A Tribute To Jack Johnson by Miles on his CV.

    They gel most successfully on the stone-cold strut of Sweetie Pie; once the central riff’s established and the band are locked in, Hoffman throws caution to the wind and embarks upon a thrillingly exploratory sax voyage. In stark contrast is their languid-to-the-point-of-being-horizontal treatment of Stevie Wonder’s Creepin’, while Samba De Negro adds demonic funk to the Brazilian flavours. Jazz heads would be advised to snap this one up while it’s still around.
