   We know Hendrix was influenced by Bob Dylan, as shown by his covers of "All Along the Watchtower" and "Like a Rolling Stone" (live at Monterey). On this star-studded live jam previously released as a bootleg called Sky High, it's obvious Jimi listened to other people, too. He opens "Red House" quoting from "Crossroads," the Cream take on a legendary Robert Johnson blues. Later, Hendrix plays a Beatles tune and further tips his hat to Eric Clapton by closing with the unmistakable "Sunshine of Your Love" riff. At times, Hendrix and Johnny Winter lock into an elemental force, although a seriously drunk Jim Morrison doesn't add much except obscenities. The drumming of Randy Z. for the first half and Buddy Miles the rest of the way produces renewed appreciation for Mitch Mitchell and the way his inventiveness meshed so well with Hendrix's brilliance. This album, which suffers from bad sound, is mandatory for completists, Hendrix fanatics and historians. For everyone else, it's a revealing glimpse into his love of jamming and the blues, including an Elmore James song.
