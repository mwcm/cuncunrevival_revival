   Despite being mentioned and acknowledged in chronicles, Québécois band AGAPE remains an unknown star in its galaxy. Their sole legacy resides in a very rare 1972 album called Le Troisième Seuil. I think that even the 11 artists of this ensemble fall into anonymity, apart from this singularly work. André Dumont provides the vocals, Michel Martel is the percussionist, trumpeter Claude Duchesneau adds a tuned flavor in seldom occasions and Jean Bourassa works on a small, recognizable load of effects. Meanwhile, three guitarists (Gilles Bergeron, Marc Lebel, François Kirouac), two bassists (Jacques Mercure, Carole Paquin) and two keyboardists (Yves Chevalier, René Depere) certainly add up to an interesting band format. Ending up uncredited is a melodic flute, airing one of the album's first pieces.

   Opinions so far converge that AGAPE's one-off mostly presents psych prog, the sound being much alike the early 70s or perhaps a year or two earlier. It's not a hybrid though, because the folk is possessive, even outside the pure progressive rock margins, with acoustic songs, ballads or half-narrative chants, the melody being accompanied just as chaste, mostly by the guitars. Psych lies instead in bit muzzier accents, Martel's sharp beats or the keyboard register (apparently containing heavier Jaculian organs). Apart from this trickier categorization, Le Troisième Seuil's impact is simpler, pleasant, bit absorbing.

   What a bizarre UFO this sole privately-released (n 72 ) album from Agape is an eleven-man formation that apparently knew how to capture their sound, because the production is very credible. Graced with a very "pro" artwork, evoking meditation over a sinister background, the back cover in a no-less interesting pagan-time drawing, enhancing the music as well as Bourassa's electronic (and others) effects. . The group consisted of two bassists, two keyboardist, two guitarists, one trumpet blower, André Dumont's vocals a percussionist and a multi-instrumentalist.

   Most likely referring to the third stage (Troisième Seuil) of enlightenment, Agape's musical world is a very wild one, starting out like a cross of UFO landing and organ concerto in some wild pagan feast, turning into a mock mass. The singer takes over on harpsichord and sings a light and enlightened folk rock tune, reminiscent of early Floyd, and a little while later of Syd or Dashiell Hedayatt's Obsolète. In the next track, the Hedayatt reminiscence are repeatedly present to the pint that one wonders if it isn't the same artist that moved to Canada. Overall the album, the music wanders from folk rock to psychedelic rock and ahippy-trippy lo-fi

   Indeed yet another real unearthed raw gem form La Belle Province where the ideas are so numerous, that had they exploited them better, they would've had enough to make another disc. Nevertheless, Agape's sole album is yet to have seen a legit Cd reissue, something that I hope will be remedied our friends at ProgQuebec. Maybe not essential, but certainly worth a hearing.
