   The third long player of experimental recordings by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Wedding Album was released by Apple in 1969.

    It was like our sharing our wedding with whoever wanted to share it with us. We didn't expect a hit record out of it. It was more of a... that's why we called it Wedding Album. You know, people make a wedding album, show it to the relatives when they come round. Well, our relatives are the... what you call fans, or people that follow us outside. So that was our way of letting them join in on the wedding.

   The couple's first collaboration, Two Virgins, marked the beginning of their relationship and artistic partnership. The follow-up, Life With The Lions, mostly documented their 1968 stay in London's Queen Charlotte Hospital, where Ono suffered a miscarriage.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Wedding Album commemorated their wedding in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969. Although it was the final instalment in their trilogy of avant garde and experimental recordings, the couple continued to document their lives on tape until Lennon's death in 1980.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Wedding Album was credited simply to "John &amp; Yoko"; their surnames did not appear anywhere on the sleeve or record labels.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The two sides of the vinyl disc each contained a single track. John And Yoko was a 22-minute recording of Lennon and Ono crying, whispering, speaking and screaming each others' names, at varying volumes and tempos, over the sound of their heartbeats.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   They had previously released the sound of their unborn child's heartbeat on the Life With The Lions track Baby's Heartbeat, but this was the first time they had used their own non-vocal bodily sounds in their recordings.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The couple first recorded John And Yoko at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, on 22 April 1969, in a session beginning at 11pm and finishing at 4.30am the following morning. Five days later they returned to remake the track, with recording and mixing completed between 3pm and 8pm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The released version was a combination of the 22 and 27 April recordings. Lennon edited the two together on 1 May 1969.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album's second side was titled Amsterdam, and featured recordings made during their first bed-in for peace. The 25-minute track began with Ono singing John John (Let's Hope For Peace), which was later performed at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival and released on Live Peace In Toronto 1969.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Much of Amsterdam consisted of interviews given by Lennon and Ono, explaining their campaigns for peace, and discussions with each other. The speech was also interspersed with the sounds of seagulls, industrial noises, traffic, children playing and sitars.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   As the bed-in was discussed in the past tense during the recording, it is likely that parts of the recording were made in London or elsewhere after the event.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Four other musical interludes were also included: Lennon performing a brief blues-style composition on an acoustic guitar, featuring the words "Goodbye Amsterdam Goodbye"; Ono singing Grow Your Hair, a song about peace and staying in bed, with Lennon on guitar; an a capella rendition of The Beatles' song Good Night; and Bed Peace, a brief recitation of the words "Bed peace" and "Hair peace".

   Unusually for the time, Apple released Wedding Album as a lavish box set. It included a reproduction of the marriage certificate, a 16-page booklet of press cuttings labelled 'The Press', a picture of a slice of wedding cake, a poster of black-and-white photos taken on their wedding day, a 'Hair Peace/Bed Peace' postcard, a PVC bag labelled 'Bagism', and a strip of four passport photographs of the happy couple.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The vinyl disc was housed in a plain white inner sleeve, inside a laminated gatefold picture sleeve. The package was designed by John Kosh, with photography by Mlle Daniau, Richard DiLello, John Kelly, Nico Koster, David Nutter and John and Yoko.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Wedding Album was available on vinyl, cassette tape and 8-track tape. The elaborate packaging led to a delay in the album being issued. It eventually appeared in the United States on 20 October 1969, and in the United Kingdom on 14 November.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album was digitally remastered and reissued on compact disc by the Rykodisc label in 1997. It included three bonus tracks: Who Has Seen The Wind? was written by Yoko Ono and originally appeared as the b-side to Instant Karma; Listen, The Snow Is Falling was the b-side to Happy Xmas (War Is Over); and Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking For Her Hand In The Snow) was a previously unreleased acoustic recording made at Queen Charlotte Hospital, London.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album did not chart in the UK, but peaked at number 178 in the United States. Because of it poor sales and the various elements to the release, mint condition copies are highly sought after by collectors.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   The UK weekly music newspaper Melody Maker ran a notorious review written by Richard Williams, who had been given a promotional copy containing two discs, each of which contained a test signal on one side. Williams duly reviewed what he thought was a double album, noting that "constant listening reveals a curious point: the pitch of the tones alters frequency, but only by microtones or, at most, a semitone. This oscillation produces an almost subliminal, uneven 'beat' which maintains interest. On a more basic level, you could have a ball by improvising your very own raga, plainsong, or even Gaelic mouth music against the drone."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Lennon and Ono were greatly amused by Williams' review, and sent a telegram of thanks.

   I have owned the vinyl edition for some years Yesterday I recived the cd reissue and since this album almost tops my list of 60's release really thrills me to hear what the CD sounds like. The vinyl has a softer side to but the cd has a different, cleaner sound. I think this release is so wnorthwihile I got it for a compilation CD project for my niece and have included Amsterdam om this 3rd volume out of 5. The wedding album is a thrill, there are few releases like it, the track John and to Yoko shifts in moods all the way from the beginning to the end and it seems that the percussion track is made up out of heart beats correct me if am wrong.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album is a little off-beat but wonderful and it was published through through Apple publications which makes it a real treat. My favorite track is Amsterdam it starts with a free form peace hymn and develops into an interview focusing on peaceful methods, the bed peace event in Amsterdam and events during the second world war. this to a pack drop of guitar/sitar sounds and phone ringing sounds from the road outside and things l like saying "Do you want so tea" questions and so on. This is the best track and it is also a perfect time piece, as this is the genuine article the first time it listened to the vinyl I was thrilled about from day one. The LP has a more lavish package because it includes a copy of the wedding certificate photos and more. But the CD on the other has a different sound, a very good complement to the original release. The two tracks speak for themselves with a sparse selves and I think the bonus track ae not really necessary as the original album speaks for itself and is enhanced with all these sounds like seagulls quacking and other things. John and Yoko were both educated artists, and this album is a sincere really good release displaying this. Because they are showing that you can create art and make lasting contributions through simple means. and Wedding Album is a great piece of art.and it is legendary.

   One of my favorite bands Swedish The Kook relaters to old music role mothers such as the Byrds have split, the Jam has quir" and also Mr Lennon said peace is in my bed so won't you please come on down".those final words refer to this event, (source The Kooks- Bruce Emms from Too Much is not Enough 1999. Now for a comment on bonus tracks by Yoko Ono single one of which is really dependent on the baroque pop sound for instance Good but too different from the actual album, which is avant garde, for the original sound collage/spoken word and more free form and much more intriguing. I Like John and Yoko's Wedding album and I now own it in two versions, it is even better than Life with Lions and it is good to see John Lennon giving everything some sincerity in the making of an album like this. It probabllu could not have been done without the inspiration provided by Yoko Ono. I am happy to see artist who try to break away from the predictable pop business and try something new for a change. This is unlike any Beatles record I have heard and think both John and Yoko was plea ¤ed with this result - with nothing left to prove this was their third LP, the only things i could compare it to is the sound collages on The Monkees Head album from 1968, or Revolution #9 from the Beatles double album also from 1968- Truly fascinating
