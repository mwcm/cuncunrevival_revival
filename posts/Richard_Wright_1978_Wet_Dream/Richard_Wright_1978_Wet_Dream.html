  As many of us, I am thinking more of Rick these days. It is true that I never considered him as he ought to be and things have to be put into perspective here. Now more than ever.
  <br/>
  First of all, his song writing capabilities should have been better recognized while he was a permanent member of the huge band we (almost) all love. Not only did he contribute to several great songs from the band, but in his first solo album Wet Dream he just confirmed this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediterranean C which is the opening track is truly superb. But it is only the first of many songs in which Mel Collins appear as a fantastic asset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also truly Floydian accents like Against The Odds in here; but this is no wonder I guess. Lyrics are quite explicit:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I don't want to talk no more tonight. We've gone through this before. Now we ask for more. Seems to me we can't escape at all. Words have no meaning. To hold such a feeling. Can there be a way out of here. I don't know. Why we go on so. I don't want to fight no more tonight. Every time's the same. Both of us to blame. I don't want to talk no more tonight...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another one is the beautiful and melodic Summer Elegy. On the soft side of course, but really catchy. It is actually on par with the superb Waves which features some fantastic sax again from Mel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rick was very clever while he hired Snowy White to hold the guitar on this album: he is just remarkable. Just listen to the passionate and melodic Drop in from the Top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pink's Song is one of the emotional one from this album: an obvious wink to dear old friend Waters: Patiently, you watched us play parts you'd seen before. Even then, we sometimes asked: would you keep us for? Sadly, then, you lost yourself. So you had to leave.

  Absolutely the most underrated album from any Floyd member for many years. God knows why? This in essence could almost be a Floyd album all on it's own. Incredible to think that also Gilmour's first solo album was also hatched at this time, Wet Dream has great contributions from Snowy White on guitar, Mel Collins on Sax, Juliette Wright with lyrics but most of all Rick Wright himself. the album is richly laden in deep textures of prog, jazz and just plain old Floydian styles. 'Against all Odds' questions the deep emotion behind relationships and their subesequent break ups. 'Waves' a perfect instrumental with stunning sax from Mel Collins. ' Summer Elegy ' for me perhaps the most slick Floyd style sing along. Let's face it when Rick Wright sings well there is probably not a better vocalist from Pink Floyd. Apologies Waters and co.' Drop in from the top' and ' Funky Deux' are excellent jazzy funk rockers and it's classics like these that introduced me to jazz/fusion in the first place. No poor songs on this album.
