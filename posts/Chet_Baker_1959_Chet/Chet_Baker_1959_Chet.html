   When this album was recorded for Riverside, Baker's superstar status was already crumbling. Multi-poll winner in 1954, an extended stay in Europe 1955/56 and an intensifying heroin addiction had removed him pretty much from the US jazz scene. Technically, he had reached his zenith on the wonderful recordings for Barclay in Paris and the great Quartet with Russ Freeman in 1956; everything that followed was nice, but lukewarm in comparison. Riverside label boss Orrin Keepnews, who had "inherited" Baker through a deal with Baker's previous label Pacific Jazz, tried his best to record Baker in a variety of settings during their 4-album deal, but none of them -- neither the date with the New York hard boppers, nor the session of Lerner/Loewe musical hits, nor the vocal date -- really took off.

   Chet, chronologically the third of these albums, was recorded during several sessions, with numerous changes in personnel and arrangements, and it's mostly a set of gentle ballads. The sidemen are among the best that Keepnews could summon -- Kenny Burrell, Pepper Adams, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, to name only a few.

   What is pretty obvious is how high on heroin Baker was. On no other record did he quite manage to play in a similar kind of slow motion, always lagging a bit behind the (slow) beat, making this one of the first more obvious stoner records. The effect is, in fact, rather fascinating. Far from spoiling the album, it adds a different dimension to it, a strangely subdued atmosphere, the sleepy feeling of 1am in the morning, which is, by the way, the best time to listen to this album. It's also an album remarkably free of sentimentalism, but also of the "lyricism" referred to on the cover (which would imply a more lightweight mood).

   Baker's performances are flawless, but subdued rather than inspired, slowed down rather than laid back. The several line-ups work, but strictly on a work level; there does not seem to be much of an emotional connection between the musicians here. Orrin Keepnews states in the liner notes that he tried a lot of things to create a good backing for Baker, but reading between the lines of the same notes, it becomes obvious that he didn't have too much of an idea what Baker's music was really about, and the fact that Baker broke into Riverside's record storage facility in search of something he could convert to money for drugs did not exactly deepen the relationship between them.

   Chet therefore remains something of an oddity; a good record, but also one that does not really show what Baker was capable of; ultimately, is the first document of Baker's descent, which would get him into prison shortly afterwards and reach its lowest point eight years later with the loss of all of his teeth. Like watching a tragedy, listening to Chet is compelling and saddening at the same time -- I can see a lot of things in this album, but no matter how soft the focus on the cover photograph is, the one thing I cannot see is the sense of romanticism associated with Baker.

   Chet Baker's penultimate session for Riverside -- which was strictly instrumental -- produced an all-star lineup to support him, including jazz heavyweights Pepper Adams, Bill Evans, and Kenny Burrell. Each of them makes important contributions to the session. Adams' baritone sax solo on "Alone Together" is one of the album's high points, while Herbie Mann and Bill Evans make their presence known on several cuts. Baker possessed one of the most melodious trumpets in jazz, compelling in its simplicity. Rarely extending his range above a single octave, he nonetheless had few peers when it came to slow, romantic ballads, which make up the playlist here. His characteristically soft approach is heard to good effect on "It Never Entered My Mind," where he works with the guitar of Kenny Burrell. Burrell and Baker also collaborate on a moving rendition of "September Song." Chet is a good place to hear Baker's special way with the horn, and is made even more attractive with the presence and contributions of top jazz artists.
