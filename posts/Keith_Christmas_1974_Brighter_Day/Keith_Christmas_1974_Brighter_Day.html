   Keith Christmas first came to prominence in the early seventies following the release of his debut album in late 1969. Keith Christmas recorded two further albums with help in the recording studio from the band Mighty Baby and toured in support of those albums with the likes of the Who, Ten Years After, King Crimson and Roxy Music. It was also during this period that Keith famously played on the David Bowie album Space Oddity and featured at the first Glastonbury festival in 1971. In early 1974 Keith temporarily abandoned his solo career for a short stint as vocalist with the Esperanto Rock Orchestra and singing on the album Danse Macabre. Following this album Keith returned to solo work and was signed to the Manticore label, which was the label, owned and managed by Emerson Lake and Palmer. This album was produced by Greg Lake and Pete Sinfield and also featured a stellar cast of supporting musicians including the likes of former King Crimson members Ian McDonald, Mel Collins and Ian Wallace and former members of the Grease Band Alan Spenner and Neil Hubbard. Two singles were released from this album and although sadly neither single made the singles chart although both are now quite collectable The American version of the album differed from it's British counterpart in that it featured the track My girl in place of the track Getting' Religion. The album was well received and Keith appeared on the British television programme The Old Grey Whistle Test and performed two tracks from the album one of which was Robin Head to promote the album. Following the release of Brighter Day Keith moved to Los Angeles where his second and final album for Manticore was recorded. Following this album Keith returned to playing low-key gigs and in the early eighties tired of the music business and retired until the late eighties when he re emerged and both recorded a number of albums and performed regularly as he does to this day.
