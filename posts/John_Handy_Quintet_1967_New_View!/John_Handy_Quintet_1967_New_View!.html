   Handy issued a great run of records on Columbia during the '60s, of which "New View!" is a distinguished member. Coming on the heels of his famous performance an Montreux (which also resulted in a must-have release), "New View!" features a revamped lineup that includes vibist Bobby Hutcherson and guitarist Pat Martino.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The result is a stimulating session of three tunes, each one offering a distinct mood and sound. Handy transforms Coltrane's standard, "Naima" into an alto flowering of lush beauty. It's a wonderful tribute to Coltrane and his composition, which is one of his most affecting. "A Little Quiet" is a gently swinging bossa nova, which features a fine, flowing solo from Hutcherson.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The relaxed mood of the release is abruptly broken with the powerful "Tears of Ole Miss," a 23-minute musical lament for the unhappy racial disharmony endured by the citizens of that state throughout the '50s and '60s. Handy and his band capture the turmoil of the civil rights movement and the resistance to it throughout the course of this exciting performance, which includes a patch of bitter and effective satire in which Handy blows a mocking chorus of "Dixie." In duration and power, "Tears of Ole Miss" rivals Mingus's best performances of "Fables of Faubus," another satirical attack on Southern racial politics.

   Handy has had an enigmatic career, one which has featured stretches of silence and mediocre releases. However, he remains a vital jazz voice, as those who have seen him in performance can attest. The series of Columbia releases that includes "New View!" includes some of the best jazz from the '60s. "New View!" is an essential part of that group of releases.

   Altoist John Handy's 1967 quintet included vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, the up and coming guitarist Pat Martino, bassist Albert Stinson and drummer Doug Sides. They really stretch out on three pieces (John Coltrane's "Naima" and an original), and New View is highlighted by Handy's emotional and episodic "Tears of Ole Miss (Anatomy of a Riot)," which clocks in at 23:45. The inside/outside music is quite picturesque, emotional, and ultimately logical. It is a pity that John Handy did not make more of an impact on the mainstream of jazz, but his three Columbia studio albums still sound fresh decades later.
