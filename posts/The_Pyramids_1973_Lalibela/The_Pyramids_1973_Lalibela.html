  We climb to the Highest Temple in Lalibela
  <br/>
  We partake of the Holy Water, eat bread and drink Tej
  <br/>
  in the Temple with our brothers.
  <br/>
  We look out over the immense, mountainous land
  <br/>
  of twelve sacred churches, and bathe our spirits
  <br/>
  in their warm majesty
  <br/>
  We drink heartily form the Holy Well of Lalibela
  <br/>
  the Sacred Place.

  Spiritual Afro-jazz-influenced ensemble the Pyramids formed in 1971 while the members were attending Antioch College in Ohio. Originally featuring saxophonist Idris Ackamoor, flutist Margo Simmons, and bassist Kimathi Asante, the group eventually added several members, including various percussionists and, at one point, two bassists. Inspired by such artists as Sun Ra and pianist Cecil Taylor, the latter of whom taught at Antioch during the '70s, the Pyramids mixed African rhythms, free jazz, and even a touch of psychedelic soul. The group toured extensively, relocated to San Francisco, and released three albums including 1973's Lalibela, 1974's King of Kings, and 1976's Birth, Speed, Merging before disbanded in 1977. In 2010, the Pyramids reunited for a tour in support of their complete catalog's reissue campaign, and the group recorded an album of all-new material at Faust's studio in Germany during the summer of 2011. Otherworldly, the Pyramids' first new album in several decades, arrived the following year.

  Lalibela was the first album recorded by The Pyramids following their landmark journey throughout Africa as students from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. The album is one of the first cutting-edge "concept" albums as each side of the LP seamlessly flows from one composition to the next in the vein of a suite painting a musical portrait of the African adventure experienced by founding members Idris Ackamoor, Margaux Simmons, and Kimathi Asante. Lalibela, Ethiopia was the inspiration for the album. A journey to experience the 12th century rock churches of Lalibela by Margaux and Idris closed out their nine-month African odyssey. The personnel for the recording was augmented by new members percussionist Bradie Speller (Hekaptah), drummer Marcel Lytle, and soprano saxophonist Tony Owens (Masai). The album has plenty percussion driven rhythms, beautiful alto sax and flute melodies, soaring out-there improvisations, ritualistic chants, meditative tone pieces, high energy modal jams, and exotic African instruments collected during the African trip.
