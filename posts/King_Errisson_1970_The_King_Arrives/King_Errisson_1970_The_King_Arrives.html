    King received his first “big break” at the age of 23 when his talent with the congas was prominently displayed in a memorable night club scene in the James Bond movie, Thunderball. He left Nassau for drama studies in Canada, formed a jazz band in New York City, and spent a year performing in a Bermuda club where he met Redd Foxx who invited King to appear at his place in Los Angeles. Sammy Davis Jr. asked King to appear on the Hollywood Palace, and Cannonball Adderly became his mentor in the recording studio.

    As a session musician, King has worked with a very diverse group of artists representing a wide variety of musical styles. King has been praised as “the unsung hero behind Motown” by Ray Singleton in her book Berry, Me, and Motown as well as by Berry Gordy in his book To Be Loved for his work with artists such as Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Michael Jackson, the Jackson Five, and many others. He has also worked with Herb Alpert, John Klemmer, Doc Severinsen, Ringo Starr, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, Jim Stafford, Swamp Dogg, Barbra Streisand, David Cassidy, Bobby Darin, Nancy Wilson, Johnny Mathis, OC Smith, Lou Rawles, Hodges James and Smith, Mickey Stevenson, Barry White and The Carpenters. He was a featured member of the Incredible Bongo Band and has been a member of Neil Diamond’s touring band since 1976.

    As a solo artist and composer, King is best known as a master of funky disco with lots of congas. His early albums are prized by “breakbeat hounds.” His more recent solo albums can be classified as jazz with a Caribbean flavor. His songs have appeared on albums by Neil Diamond, Eddie Kendricks, Flora Purim, The Temptations, and in the soundtrack of the movie, Ted and Venus.

    As an actor, King has appeared in the movies Uptown Saturday Night (with Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier) and on television in Abe Vigoda’s Fish series and The Watcher, the 1980 remake of The Jazz Singer with Neil Diamond, and the movie Thunderball with Sean Connery.

    King also stars in a music video of the song Mountains of Love. He sings and dances in addition to playing the congas.

    Zola's got an absolutely insane Afro-Caribbean percussion workout in the middle, one of the best I've ever heard. But apart from that, the A-side's awfully tame. I was hoping a five minute track called Dracula would be awesome. It, uh, isn't.

    But the B-side smokes. B1's an eight and a half minute soul/early funk groover with some surprising left-turns into free jazzy territory. Would be even funkier if it were a bit slower, but it's still a neat track. B2, on the other hand, is a monster. Has an even faster tempo, this time crossing over into James Brown's impossibly nimble military precision jitter funk, plus a slightly Chicago-y horn section and some remarkable drumming/trumpet playing. And that leaves B3, which is "Highlife sunny chords + groove-based funk drumming" but not quite as good as that sounds.

    Still, there's thirty eight minutes of music on this thing and twenty two minutes of it is worth hearing. That ain't bad.
