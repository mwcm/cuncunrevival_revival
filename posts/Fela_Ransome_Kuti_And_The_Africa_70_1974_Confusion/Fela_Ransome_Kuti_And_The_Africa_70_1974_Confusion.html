   This Afrobeat epic contains just one eponymous track clocking in at just over 25 minutes in length, and beginning with a mysterious and psychedelic musical interplay between Fela on organ and Tony Allen on drums. As the song takes on a righteously funky groove, Fela evokes the chaos of Lagos — the multitude of regional dialects, the gnarly traffic jams, the absence of a policeman to take charge — as a metaphor for the larger problems of post-colonial Nigeria.

   4 mins of really awesome freeform jazz.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A slow buildup: first bass, then electric guitar and tenor guitar (about the same time), and before you know it, the groove has started.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Over this (by now extremely intense) groove, you hear a few improvised solos (2 sax solos and a trumpet solo).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The (really intense) groove continues for a few minutes, then it calms down, and Fela starts humming, then starts singing. Call and response chorus comes, his backing singers doing the response. Continues for about 5-6 mins.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After the singing, the groove having built up throughout, it is back at full intensity, and there is another solo or 2. Then the song gradually stops, then there is another minute of freeform jazz, and the song ends with all the instruments playing a chord each (and the percussionists hitting their instruments a few times).

   25 and a half minutes of the absolute best african funk music (not to mention the awesome freeform jazz). Essential for any fan of african music, freeform jazz, funk, or any fan of good music.

   What is there to say about Confusion? It's Fela's most epic composition, beginning with dark, minimalist funk before slowly expanding into one of his fullest and most lively Afrobeat jams. The piece is backed by the greatest production Fela would ever get, emphasizing the psychedelic qualities of his sustained tones and group vocals. It features potentially his greatest lyric sheet, a scathing indictment of colonial politics and the amorphous identity it imposed upon Nigerian people and culture. On top of that, Fela also composed maybe his funkiest guitar lines and organ riffs for this piece, locked them into a single, nearly 26-minute track, and gave his band free reign to improvise within his groove.

   "Confusion" is the gold standard of long-form funk, and easily the most essential Africa '70 album. A watershed moment for music, and an album that will change the way you look at the world. A must-hear.
