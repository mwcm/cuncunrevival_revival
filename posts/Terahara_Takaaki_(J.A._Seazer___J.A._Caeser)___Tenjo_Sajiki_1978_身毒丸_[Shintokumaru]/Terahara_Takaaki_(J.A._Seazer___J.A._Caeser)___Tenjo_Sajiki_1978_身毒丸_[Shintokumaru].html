   When it comes to 70's Progressive Rock the Japanese scene tends to get ignored in favor of the more prolific and well known scenes such as those of Germany and Scandinavia. Well, at least that's the best justification I can think of as to why the brilliant Shintokumaru is widely ignored by the Prog community. It's truly a shame that a potential classic such as this is slowly being forgotten and lost to time. With Shintokumaru Tenjo Sajiki manage to blend traditional Japanese folk and theatre with western Opera and Prog to create a stunning and completely unique Avant-Rock Opera. Despite being released nearly 30 years ago this album stands without peer and remains as unique as ever. The music is made with various traditional and non-traditional instruments ranging from the standard Rock Guitar to the much less overexposed Shamisen. Being a Rock Opera there are quite a few different vocalists and styles put on display here, dominating most of the album are the traditional Opera vocalists. Styles range from chants to spoken word, featured alongside both the male and female vocalists is a young child as well. I'd love to comment on the story as well as the acting however the language barrier makes that a bit tough. If I ever learn Japanese I'll expand on that matter, but for now, no comment.

   The Opera opens to a lone Shamisen being plucked delicately and accompanied only by a Soprano. After a short spoken word section from one of the male vocalists the piece explodes into Hard Prog Rock with an electric Guitar. The style is very unique and very interesting the piece is constantly twisting and changing, flying in different directions like a hyper active kid. It never really seems to settles on a single theme or focus throughout a piece, yet still manages to keep it's consistency and not sound too disjointed. The second piece introduces us to the child who is introduced through a short spoken word section with some nice string backing. It also has some strange circus like sections, the significance of which I'm unaware of, but the musical quality of which I can easily identify. The third piece "髪切虫" is to me a very interesting piece in which it sounds like a couple arguing while a young woman sings faintly almost inaudibly in the background, after their argument ends the child sings a strange little tune before being angrily yelled at. It would probably make more sense if I knew what was going on, but never the less I enjoy the piece. If I were to explain the different facets of the album I would end up describing every track, and I have no intentions of turning this into a track-by-track review. So I'll just say that each track is distinct and has something of value, nothing sounds generic or repetitive.

   The album has more than enough diversity to satisfy any fan of Progressive or Art Rock. It can be a bit bizarre and esoteric at times, but overall the quality of the album should be enough to satisfy most music connoisseurs. It may not be something that has mass appeal, but if it can manage to find it's way to it's niche audience it might just survive the passage of time as the classic it is.

   Zeuhl mixed with Japanese traditional music mixed with stretches of dialogue.  Despite being a recording of a stage performance, Shintokumaru succeeds spectacularly as an album, even without any understanding of the Japanese language.  Much of the praise should go to Shuji Terayama, who maintains a masterful sense of emotional build throughout, puncturing his spoken word sections with Wagnerian explosions at opportune times.  With repeated listens (and this work requires repeated listens), the dialogue even starts to sound like "songs" as you become cognizant of the vocal inflections of the actors, and begin to look forward to certain bizarrely "catchy" spoken passages.  Just like a memorable lover, Shintokumaru reveals its charms slowly, and only when you've given it the respect that it deserves.
