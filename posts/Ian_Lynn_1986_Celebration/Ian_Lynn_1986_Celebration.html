   Ian was performing in London's West End as a jazz pianist whilst still in his teens, and rose to prominence as a musician during the seventies when he became Musical Director for singer Barbara Dickson, a role he enjoyed for many years. In the same capacity, he also worked during that time with Sheena Easton, Gerry Rafferty, and Leo Sayer, performing all over the world in venues from intimate jazz clubs to massive football stadiums.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Since then he has divided his efforts between writing scores for TV and film, and making documentary films, although still finding time to be asked to work with George Michael, Katrina and the Waves, Miriam Stockley (Adiemus), Lance Ellington and many stars of musical theatre such as Elaine Paige and Michael McCarthy.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Film credits have included Sweet Talker (Taylor Hackford), The Clandestine Marriage (Sir Nigel Hawthorne) and one of 2006's Royal Premiere films, These Foolish Things, starring Lauren Bacall, Angelica Houston and Terence Stamp. In TV he has scored every genre of programme, from all the Great Railway Journeys series, to the TV feature film Bravo Two Zero.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He has lectured in film and music at Kingston University, and in media contextual studies at Ravensbourne College. He still enjoys teaching and runs a successful recording studio and video post-production suite, and enjoys doing his own camera work and video editing.

   Ian was invited to the States a few years ago to frontline the music for America's 400th celebrations. He also showcases new artists in selected venues such as Pizza on the Park and the Green Room in London, and is often on the lookout for preview venues. Ian now resides with his new wife, Margaret, in the Isle of Wight, where his maternal grandmother was born. Still a frequent visitor to the North Island, he hopes to develop a relationship with Classic FM in the promotion of classical music.
