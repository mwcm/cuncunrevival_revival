     BBC Light Programme - Stay Tuned!

   </b>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On 7 March 1962 the Beatles entered a BBC studio for their first session. It was the beginning of a long relationship between the group and BBC radio and was of tremendous importance for their success. These sessions are among the most important documents of the Beatles' music for two main reasons. First of all, the BBC had regulations limiting the number of discs which could be played during the transmissions, so whenever possible the songs were performed live in their studios. The Beatles did not escape this rule, and each number to be broadcast, including their hits, was recorded live a few days or weeks before being aired. Some of these BBC versions can hardly be distinguished from the commercially released ones, but often slight differences (particularly in guitar solos) can be appreciated. In a few cases the songs were played in noticeably different arrangements, and there are even BBC sessions which unquestionably beat the takes recorded at Abbey Road studios: "Honey Don't", Pop Go The Beatles, September 3, 1963; "I Saw Her Standing There", Easy Beat, October 20, 1963; "Rock And Roll Music", Saturday Club, December 26, 1964; "Long Tall Sally", Top Gear, July 16, 1964, are but a few examples. But the real gems of these sessions are all the classics of the fifties and early sixties rock and pop music, performed on BBC and never commercially released by the group.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Why did the Beatles play these songs instead of only promoting their records? At the beginning, they had not yet released enough songs to fill all the programmes, nearly one a week. Later, these performances added exciting surprises to fans waiting to hear their favourite group playing live on the BBC. As a result, these programmes were very similar to their live stage performances. A BBC session also provided the opportunity to try out covers which could later be commercially released. Only on the last shows did the Beatles limit themselves to promoting the commercial releases: by late 1963 they had already conquered the world, and fans just wanted to hear the songs found on the records. What's sure is that the boys had great fun in the BBC studios, joking with the announcers or reading letters from fans; some of the chats in-between the songs are as pleasant as the musical performances. The influences which were important to each of the Beatles also can be recognized. John, for example, was a great fan of Chuck Berry. He sang eight Berry songs, always with great personality, and he had great pleasure in covering Arthur Alexander's tunes. Paul sang powerful covers of Little Richards' numbers which very closely match the original version. But he also was attracted to popular music hits, such as a "rock" version of "Besame Mucho" and the title song from the film "Honeymoon". George, beside performing a few classics, often played a different, more rockabilly rendition of the guitar solos than on the commercially released songs; his covers of Carl Perkins' records are unforgettable. Ringo, apart from his occasional numbers, always displays a very precise rhythm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Beatles performed ninety different songs on BBC radio, two of which were taped but not broadcast ("Sheila" and "Three Cool Cats"). Some of these were played many times (usually their hits which were to be promoted, such as "From Me To You", featured in 15 different programmes, but also unreleased songs, such as "Memphis, Tennessee" which had five appearances); many other songs were executed just once, for a total of 288 transmitted performances, including occasional renditions of traditional tunes ("Happy Birthday", etc.). In a few cases, a song was taped once and broadcast on two different programmes. Thirty-six songs have not been commercially released, and many other numbers, later included on their LPs, were presented on BBC radio months or even more than a year before their eventual release. Indeed, considering the few, often low-quality, live concerts available, the BBC sessions represent a true mirror of how the "live Beatles" were on stage. This explains the immense interest of these tracks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   We will not fool anyone by saying that this material has not been previously available to collectors (although two of the programmes and some other songs here included have never been released in any form ). However, it is true that until now all these songs were scattered among many different sources, so that a comprehensive collection would need various LPs, CDs and a few of the tapes which have been traded since the early seventies. Also, sound quality was in general not fully satisfying, at least for many sources. The BBC itself preserved very few programmes in its archives. This is the first attempt to organize all the material available to collectors in the most complete form, chronologically arranged, and with the best possible sound quality. To achieve this aim, we have checked every available source for each track, and in some cases fragments from different sources had to be edited to restore the song the way it was originally performed and in its best possible quality (this is, for example, the case with "Ooh! My Soul", "So How Come (No One Loves Me)", one of the "Memphis" takes, and a few others). Obviously, all our efforts have been addressed to recreate the original sound as it was broadcast about thirty years ago, avoiding any kind of alteration. All this material has been chronologically arranged according to the transmission date (not the recording session date). To provide collectors, and also "normal" Beatles listeners, with the best possible sound quality, DAT masters have been processed with Sonic Solutions software, a powerful digital medium which has helped editing and equalizing. Whenever possible, the particularly boring tape drop-outs have been corrected. Over 100 hours were spent at the mastering studios (plus the hours spent at home checking each track ...), but the results are encouraging, and we hope it's been worthwhile. A few of the original tapes were of really low quality; in these cases there's not much to be done but try to cut background noise to recover the sound; of course, sound distorsions can only be attenuated. However, apart from these very few tracks, the general quality of the recordings is noticeably good. We have mainly been concerned with the musical performances, so we apologize if a few seconds of chat is missing. We also apologize for any mistakes that may have occurred, we tried our best, but no one is perfect. The interview-only programmes have not been included, nor have the TV shows which had also a radio airing. The programme themes which were taped only once and used for all the numbers in the series (such as "Pop Go The Beatles") have been included in the first programme of the series only. The theme of "From Us To You" has always been included.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
   Of the 288 performances which were aired, 247 have been recovered and are included on these CDs. It should be very interesting to rediscover the lost tracks; should any Beatle collector have tapes from BBC programmes (from unidentified as well as already known programms, and even if in poor quality), we'll be glad to hear from him/her. If we find some of the apparently lost tracks, an updated release can be pressed!

   Considering the tremendous importance of the material performed and broadcast in the fifty-two BBC sessions, it is no surprise that many LP and, lately, CD releases have appeared. It is not possible to detail every single production here but some notes on the most important records nevertheless should be of interest. These notes are derived from a forthcoming book which will report on every known unofficial Beatles record.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The first record to contain Beatles BBC radio performances, and one of the most important Beatles bootlegs from the historical point of view, was released in August 1971 by TMOQ (Trade Mark of Quality), a legendary California company which produced, from 1970 to 1975, more than a hundred different unofficial records by many top rock and pop groups. This first record was titled "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD" and contained 14 "BBC" songs, thirteen of which were never recorded for EMI (the other one was "Slow Down"). These were derived from the Pop Go The Beatles programmes of July and August 1963. The first pressing of this LP had the typical coloured cardboard jacket of TMOQ, with a round sticker with a pig logo, rubber-stamped title (reading "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD - PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED STUDIO MATERIAL"), round a label with a large 1 or 2 for side indicators, and coloured vinyl. Its sound quality was reasonably good. The matrix number was BBL-513. It became one of the most sought-after items by Beatles collectors, and during the seventies (and into the eighties) the stamper BBL-513 was used for a great number of repressings, with differences in labels and sleeve, and coloured as well as black, or even multicoloured, vinyl. The issues released from 1973 to 1976 also had the catalogue number 71032 printed on a slipsheet. A different tape, including the same songs in slightly superior sound quality, was used in late 1971 or early 1972 by another outfit known to collectors as White Cover Folks, probably from the eastern coast of the USA. This had the matrix number YMC-101, the same title, "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD", a red label marked "Yellow Records", and a track listing. After a few reissues, it was repressed in 1975 from the original stampers by Berkeley Records, with the misleading title "THE DECCA AUDITION TAPES". These two original LPs were copied by other manufacturers. The TMOQ record gave rise to the Contra Band Music (CBM) issues, which first appeared in early 1972 on a 2-LP set titled "DON'T PASS ME BY", matrix CBM 2C1/2D1. This set included the Christmas records and, as second disc, TMOQ LP with the addition of "The Saints" and "My Bonnie" from the Polydor Hamburg record. Starting in May 1973, this second disc was also distributed as a single LP with the usual title "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD". There were repressings (often of poor quality) until 1976. The "Yellow Records" version was copied by Dittolino Discs and issued in 1972 and 1973; this producer originally released it in a cover rubber-stamped with "14 UNRELEASED EARLY BEATLES CUTS". The subsequent editions had an insert titled "AS SWEET AS YOU ARE" (from the song "Don't Ever Change"). The stamper used for these issues was numbered D-1/2. In September 1976 it reappeared for K.O. Records (a name used by the Wizards group). The "Yellow Records" release was also copied by TMOQ-Smokin' Pig (to be distinguished from the original TMOQ by the Smoking Pig logo on their labels), for an LP released in 1973 and again titled "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD" (matrix and catalogue number 1858). In summer 1975 Wizardo Records reproduced the thirteen unreleased songs, together with a few other BBC tracks copied from other records, on the LP "ORIGINAL AUDITION TAPE CIRCA 1962" (another misleading title... - and they knew it!). Other issues date from the mid-eighties, with a European fake "CBM" titled "AS SWEET AS JOU ARE" (sic!) and a "new""YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD" version pressed by Starlight Records in 1990. The songs on the latter were taken from sources of better sound quality, and six more tracks were added.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   More songs appeared in May 1972, again from TMOQ. This time two LPs, with the titles "OUTAKES 1" and "OUTAKES 2", contained the BBC versions of 21 commercially released songs, plus "Lucille" and "The Hippy Hippy Shake". This material was from Pop Go The Beatles and Saturday Club. The sound quality was comparable with that of the previous release. The records were on matrix BO-519 and BO-520, and the first pressing had coloured vinyl, a rubber-stamped cover with a pig sticker, and white labels with a black 1 and 2 for the sides, and two thin black rings around their border. The further issues, in part on black vinyl, featured the pig label; also a 2-LP set coupling the two single LPs was released. CBM copied the TMOQ records in 2 single LPs, titled "STUDIO SESSIONS VOL. 1" and "STUDIO SESSIONS VOL. 2". They were originally released in May 1973, with the title printed on the label, and subsequently repressed with various generic labels until 1976. In late 1979 or early 1980 the Japanese label Black Discs released these records on matrix ZAP-1061 / 1062. Twenty of these songs were joined together by Wizardo on a single album, titled "WORDS OF LOVE" in its first pressing released in August 1975 and subtitled "STUDIO OUTAKE RECORDINGS 1962-64" in the later issues (continuing the tradition of misleading titles). These issues were on matrix WRMB-326 and had noticeably worse sound quality. Another compilation featuring part of the songs included on the two "OUTAKES" LPs was produced by Wizardo in September 1976, entitled "THE LAST BEETLE RECORD" (matrix 393, black "World Records" label). Excerpts from the "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD" and "OUTAKES 1 &amp; 2" LPs were spread over a great number of records distributed in the second half of the seventies and in the first half of the eighties. There is no use in listing them here. More material appeared in the early seventies; this did not usually fill a complete LP: one or a few tracks, at times a single programme, were added to other material. The first programme to appear was Top Of The Pops, the U.S. rebroadcast of Top Gear July 16, 1964. This was independently released by an anonymous label on the album titled "THE BEATLES LAST ALBUM" and by CBM on "THE NEVER RELEASED MARY JANE". The first one was released in (possibly) late 1971 or early 1972, matrix 01 971. It was copied in 1972 by White Cover Folks as "LIVE AT NASSAU", matrix 999, originally distributed with a yellow label. This album was repressed in 1973 and 1974 as "TOP OF THE POPS/LIVE IN GERMANY". The CBM record ("THE NEVER RELEASED MARY JANE"), with matrix 3585, was originally distributed in November 1972 with a purple slipsheet and label with printed title. The subsequent issues had generic labels and usually a blue printed insert. This session was also included on a record by Highway HiFi, a subsidiary of TMOQ-Smokin' Pig, titled "TOP OF THE POPS", matrix HHCER 111. This LP was first issued in mid-1974 with a slipsheet printed with "rainbow" effect and repressed a number of times until 1983. In the late seventies the programme Top Of The Pops was independently rereleased by two different manufacturers on 7" EPs. One of these versions, in excellent quality, was on matrix 45x45000/45001 and bore fake "Capitol" P-9431 labels; the other one, from Brown Cloud Records (a name for a Melvin Records issue), had worse sound. Some more BBC items resurfaced in 1973; the following records contained previously unreleased material. "HAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD", by CBM, featured 3 tracks which had been broadcast on the BBC programme "The Beatles Story", transmitted in 1972; it was distributed in February 1973 and its first pressing had a label with a printed title and a red insert; matrix is WEC-3624. This record, quite surprisingly in view of its low level of interesting material and low sound quality, had an astonishing number of repressings and copies, including one by Amazon Etcetera released in 1974 or early 1975. In late spring 1973 CBM distributed another album, titled "PEACE OF MIND", matrix WEC Rl-3670, which, among various material, also included a few songs taken from the BBC sessions, in low quality. Its first pressing had generic labels with side indications. In late 1974 this too was copied by Amazon Etcetera records. In June 1973 TMOQ released "MARY JANE", matrix MJ-543, featuring in good audio quality parts of the June 30, 1964 From Us To You programme plus excerpts from Top Of The Pops; it was distributed in purple cardboard with rubber-stamped title and square gold pig sticker, red vinyl, and a black label with silver pig. The reissues were subtitled "SPICY BEATLES SONGS"; in the late seventies and early eighties it also reappeared as "BUG CRUSHER 'LIVE'", from the original stamper. More repressings of the MJ-543 stamper, usually distributed with the first titles, date back to the mid and late eighties. The June 30, 1964 session reappeared on the CBM release "SWEDEN 1963", matrix WEC 3795, produced in July 1973; it had deluxe labels with the title printed on them. Very little material appeared in 1974: on "RARE BEATLES" (also titled "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" on another insert), CBM TB5030, distributed in March 1974, four previously unreleased songs made their debut, unfortunately in poor quality and noticeably slow (among these, "Johnny B. Goode" can hardly be recognized!). This LP first appeared with blank labels and had a few repressings on various other CBM labels. The record "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" by Wizardo Records, WRMB 345, featured the BBC track of this song plus songs from other records, in part BBC numbers. "SOLDIER OF LOVE", released in summer 1974 with a yellow CBM "pirate" label, a back cover featuring a D'Anunzio drawing pasted over the CBM "cartoon" print, matrix TB-1022, features the first appearance on LP of "I'll Be On My Way", in quite poor quality (a very rare 7" single had already been released), together with a few other numbers, among which is of course the title track. The last album for a few years to contain BBC material, released in December 1974, was the rare "STOCKHOLM", an LP by CBM on its Instant Analysis yellow label. This featured tracks from the "Easy Beat" show of July 21, 1963, in dreadful quality.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   No more "new" BBC songs appeared between 1975 and 1977, only compilations recycling previously released material appeared. New items suddenly flooded the market in 1978, when the important label "Ruthless Rhymes" was founded. "FROM US TO YOU - A PARLOPHONE REHEARSAL SESSION" is a 10" disc featuring the rehearsals for the fourth From Us To You programme. It was released in May 1978 on coloured vinyl, matrix LMW 28 IF, Ruthless Rhymes label, and was later copied on matrix 10 A/B. A new LP by the same label was distributed in June 1978, titled "YOUNGBLOOD". This included on side A 10 BBC cuts, some of which were previously unreleased, but unfortunately the performances were not included in their complete form. This record on matrix BVP-005-RE had a deluxe b&amp;w printed cover, two versions of which exist. The first one, with the group on stage, and a second one, with the Beatles in the field. The original stamper had a few reissues, with various labels (blank, Hohrweite and Stereophonie); a different version was released by Gotham Records in the early eighties: this retained the original cover, but replaced part of the new BBC tracks with other BBC material (already known) or with some Decca numbers. It was on matrix BVP-005. The counterpart of "YOUNGBLOOD" was released in late 1978 by Odd Records as "DEC. 63". This album copies side B of the Ruthless Rhymes production (a Liverpool live show) and adds four tracks from Saturday Club of December 26, 1964, previously unreleased. Apart from the poor audio quality, however, these are affected by overdubbed "live audience" screams, which make them completely useless. "DEC. 63" was repressed in 1982 by Modern Jazz Records as "FIRST U.S. SHOW" (a very imprecise title, as the record does not contain anything from the USA...).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1980 a tape with songs in excellent quality reached the producers, and the result was a series of astonishing releases. The first on is a 7" EP titled "FOUR BY THE BEATLES", by Hohrweite Stereophonie, matrix L-1453. This features 4 tracks from the July 16, 1963 Pop Go The Beatles, including some chat. Although three of these were already known to collectors, the audio quality here is excellent. This single, released in April 1980, had many repressings with various sleeves and, subsequently, with "BBC Transcription Service" labels, and was also copied by Gear Records on 2 single 7" discs. These tracks reappeared on an LP by the same producer, "BROADCASTS", matrix L-2087 NR 771 x 100. This record included 18 BBC numbers in excellent quality, in part unreleased. It was distributed in July 1980 on green or black "BBC Transcription Service" labels, deluxe full colour cover (which was later used for a picture disc produced by another manufacturer). As expected, this LP had a series of reissues in the eighties, including one on coloured vinyl by Box Top Records, and was copied by other manufacturers. Even today it should be considered as one of the most interesting Beatles bootlegs. A further release distributed in July 1980 by the same producer under the POD Records label was "ROUGH NOTES". This is a miscellaneous LP, which features 4 BBC songs, three of which were unreleased at the time (from March 30, 1964 From Us To You) and the other one is "I'll Be On My Way" in better, although not particularly good, quality. Its matrix is L-2408-SR-73941, and it was released with 2 different b/w laminated covers.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   More than a year after these issues, a very important new LP appeared on the market, "SILVER DAYS (AIR TIME)" contained, besides a perfect copy of the Sweden October 24, 1963 concert, many songs from the BBC sessions, in excellent quality. Some of these tracks had already been known for more than 10 years, but here they sound almost perfect. This album was distributed in October 1981, matrix L-7198-MX 4729; on the cover it was credited to "Johnny and the Moondogs" (one of the Beatles' earlier names). Its first pressing had a blank label, the back cover had a sticker with track listing, and the front cover had a sticker with "AIR TIME" (hence it's common title). More issues were on the Subway Records label (although the cover says Warwick Records), lacking stickers. A few months later, in January 1982, another very important LP, "BEAUTIFUL DREAMER", was released in the USA (all these records were produced by the same manufacturers, under different names). This is the first album to contain tracks from the very early BBC appearances, for example the title song; it's on matrix L-8346-DH-9501 and has a nice full colour jacket. Another producer released "WONDERFUL PICTURE OF YOU" in May 1982, matrix SKI-5430, Circle Records. This is a 2-LP set, which, to a copy of an older record featuring some "Get Back" material, was added some BBC sampler tapes. Very interesting, previously unreleased songs are included, among which are tracks taken from their very first Teenagers Turn programme. The weak point is that these cuts were only in fragments, badly edited and partly off-speed. However, sound quality for a few of them has not been equalled yet.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In early 1982 the BBC (after suggestions by a Beatle fan) decided to prepare a memorial programme to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the first Beatles BBC sessions. This was quite a difficult task, as only very few parts of the Beatles sessions had survived in the BBC archives. However, using these few programmes and some of the songs which had previously appeared on unofficial releases, the BBC could eventually manage a two-hour programme, which was aired on March 7, 1982. Needless to say, this show was immediately reproduced on a 2-LP set by "Radio Transcription Records", matrix CBB-20 released in June 1982. The BBC show was rearranged by American radio networks, with the addition of some tracks taken from the most recent LPs (in particular "BEAUTIFUL DREAMER" and "SILVER DAYS"). The programme, which was aired in U.S. between May 29 and 31, 1982, was used to produce a couple of LPs: "THE BEATLES BBC", by Dream Records, matrix L-9743-DR-36282 and "WITH LOVE FROM US TO YOU", by Oro Records, matrix L-10328-ORO-6365; both these LPs were released in July 1982. The second one also contained a poster, but, from a musical point of view, they obviously did not add anything new to our knowledge.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On December 27, 1982 BBC aired an expanded version of the Beatles special, with more songs chosen from among those left out in the first edition and included in the American ones, plus some of the material which was traded among collectors on tape (excerpts from the first BBC session of March 8, 1962, for example). This three-hour programme was rebroadcast in the U.S. in May 1983 and, as its preceding one, it was soon transcripted to unofficial records. The first one to appear was a 3-LP set titled "THE BEATLES AT THE BEEB" by (fake) London Wavelength Records, matrix AT THE BEEB A-H. It was released in July 1983 and was the direct transcription of the programme, including commercials. A slightly subsequent release by a different manufacturer was titled "THE BEATLES AT THE BEEB - THE STORY OF THEIR RADIO CAREER", again on (fake) London Wavelength Records labels. This had a better pressing and commercials were edited out; it was on matrix HOUR 1/2/3 and each record had a label of a different colour (red, green and blue). The original stampers were also used for a copy on picture disc, which was included in the 5-LP box "SO MUCH YOUNGER THEN", produced in 1985. A Japanese version, whose pressing is extremely good, is a 2-LP set, which did not include all the songs broadcast by the BBC and cut all the interviews and comments by the presenter of the show. This record is titled "BEATLES BROADCAST COLLECTION" and is on matrix BBC 1/2/3/4. At this point, collectors had a comparatively good representation of the BBC material available. Some compilations or copies of the aforementioned records started appearing, but all the sources were fragmentary. Even the BBC programmes failed to give comprehensive information, as obviously the producers of the memorials chose only the songs available in better quality of those of greater importance.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   An essential addition to the collection of BBC tracks came in December 1984, with the release of "DIRECTLY FROM SANTA CLAUS, RARE UNRELEASED BEATLES TRACK", a now rare European picture disc which featured 18 songs as yet unreleased. All these songs were arranged in chronological order of original broadcast (except for a single mistaken attribution) and derived from some tapes which were traded at the time. Although sound quality was not always satisfying, this record gained an extraordinary importance for completists: until now, in fact, it contained tracks not available elsewhere on disc.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The most important series of Beatles BBC unofficial releases started in October 1986, when the first of 13 LPs with BBC sessions, titled "THE BEATLES AT THE BEEB - VOL. 1" to "VOL. 13", appeared. The tapes originating this series had long been preserved by a U.K. collector, who in the middle of the eighties traded them with some Dutch friends. The material was then given to a group of European producers who started the release of the records on the label "Beeb Transcription Records". The first 9 volumes were pressed in Europe, while the last four volumes, due to some problems which arose at the pressing plants, were produced in the USA at two different plants, one of which used noticeably worse vinyl. The absolute importance of this series is that it brings us an incredible amount of previously unreleased sessions, often including chats and announcements. Moreover, sound quality is in general very good, often excellent, and the liner notes (although excessively emphatic) give useful information. A few weak points however affected this production. First of all, some of the incomplete programmes could have been at least in part completed taking the available missing songs from already released sources. Some songs in poor quality could have been replaced with those available in better sound. Slight work with filters and equalizers on the original tapes could have increased the overall audio quality, which sometimes suffers from some hiss or is not equalized. Unfortunately, the tapes start from 1963, thus all the first BBC sessions are missing (and probably many of them are lost forever). The series ended with Vol. 13 in December 1988. These LPs were in part copied in the USA as 2-LP sets, and a few of them also had an issue on coloured vinyl. Starting from 1989, the complete series was transferred onto CD by the European producers Pyramid Records. All these CDs appeared with a stock sleeve saying "RADIOACTIVE", to which some US and European distributors added a reduced copy of the original LP covers. When it was clear that the "BEATLES AT THE BEEB" producers did not own the tapes of the first programmes, some European and U.S. manufacturers (not directly related to the "BEEB" producers) pressed a further record, which included these missing sessions. The first one to appear was "MEET THE BEEB", released in April 1988, on matrix 800, designed to look like number 0 of the "BEEB" series. It was a European record, of much worse sound quality than the tapes from which it was derived. Of course, all the material was unreleased at the time, so this record was nevertheless quite interesting.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   An American attempt with a slightly more complete track listing was released in summer 1988. It was titled "THE BEATLES AT THE BEEB WITH PETE BEST", by Drexel Records, matrix L-31 1 23-BEEB 6263 (the lacquers of the "BEEB" volumes 10 and 11 were produced at the same plant). This time the tapes were of better quality, but the release is ruined by a very hissy and noisy pressing. The third attempt, and the worst of all, was released by Tiger Beat Records in December 1988 (this label also pressed the last two "BEEB" volumes). They included on "THE LOST BEEBS", matrix TBR LP-2, also tracks missing from the "BEEB" series: these were taken from "YELLOW MATTER CUSTARD", but sound was awfully distorted, worse than on the original 1971 record! With these releases, nearly all the surviving BBC sessions were published. The BBC itself acquired the "BEEB" series and produced a new 14-episode memorial series, including also a few other sessions which meanwhile had surfaced from their archives; this programme was broadcast in the U.K. from October 1 to December 31, 1988, and, in a somewhat different version, in the USA in the next year. Lots of compilations were derived from these releases of BBC programmes. Among these, the most interesting are the Swingin' Pig 3-LP/2-CD sets "FROM US TO YOU" and the Japanese 2-CD set "THE BEATLES ON BBC". In 1992 a 9-CD series appeared in Europe, claiming to be the complete BBC catalogue ("THE BBC BEATLES: COMPLETE CATALOGUE VOL. 1-9"). However, this was simply produced by adding "AT THE BEEB WITH PETE BEST" to the "Pyramid" CDs, and mastering the programmes according to the broadcast date; the tracks missing from the Pyramid CDs have not been added, and those incomplete or in poorer quality have not been replaced with the ones available in better sound.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The 10-CD set which we have produced should represent the definitive collection of the Beatles' BBC Sessions now available, chronologically arranged, and in the best sound quality. Enjoy listening to the Beatles at the Beeb and...

     COMPILING THE 'LOST' TAPES
    </b>
   </span>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Down in the BBC vaults, we were told, they had stumbled upon golden tapes containing long lost recordings of the Beatles' radio performances. It was hailed as the greatest and most fortuitous discovery since the unearthing of Tutankhamun's tomb, but then RICHARD BUSKIN,intrepid reporter, got on the case and spoke to BBC Radio producer Kevin Howlett and Abbey Road Studios engineer, Peter Mew. The truth, he learned, differed somewhat from the hype.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Well, well, well, here we go again! What is it about publicity and press hacks that compels them, every timesome legendary, previously-unreleased material is unleashed on the general public, to summon up images of said tapes being discovered down in the vaults? For one thing, just how many record companies do, in fact, have these mysterious - and, no doubt, cobweb-infested - underground storage chambers; and secondly, are we to assume that there are regularly exploratory expeditions undertaken in order to seek out even more of this hidden treasure? You can just imagine the scene..... Indiana Jones, eat your heart out!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Indeed, in the case of the recently released Beatles radio sessions, we were informed by news reports on the BBC itself that the vaults in which the tapes were actually 'dust-encrusted', which doesn't say too much for the work of the BBC archivists. Furthermore the tapes were miraculously all found to be in pristine condition, and they contained songs which nobody could recall the Beatles ever performing. Well, to all this I will say just one thing - and, being my usual diplomatic self, I will do so in a typically restrained manner - what a pile of tosh.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Of the 275 Beatles recordings broadcast by the BBC between March 8, 1962 and June 7, 1965, various were in fact re-broadcast by the network in a two hour special entitled The Beatles At The Beeb in 1982. A three hour version was subsequently syndicated in other countries, and in 1988, there was a series of 14 half hour shows entitled The Beeb's Lost Beatles Tapes. What is more, the fans have had bootleg recordings of many of these sessions since the early 1970's. during the past year, an Italian company has even put out a nine CD boxed set containing every single number the band committed to tape in the BBC studios. The only reason for the delay was the protracted legal wrangling between the BBC, EMI Records (to whom the Beatles were contracted from 1962 onwards), and the group's own company Apple Corp. So let's not talk about the mass rediscovery of long lost masters.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

    <span style="font-size: large;">
     DISCOVERING THE TOMB
    </span>
   </b>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Kevin Howlett, a senior producer at BBC Radio 1, wrote the sleeve notes for the new album, The Beatles, Live At The BBC, having previously re-engineered - and acted as a conduit in the location of - much of the material that was used for the 1982 and 1988 re-broadcasts.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "At the press launch for the album, the first question I was asked was whether it was like discovering Tutankhamen's tomb," he says. "So I replied that the material was very exciting and that I therefore suppose you could use that analogy if you want to. That was a mistake, however, because the reporter then quoted me as asserting, 'it was like discovering Tutankhamun's tomb!' I should have been wise to his little ploy, because in truth I feel that the material is much more a time capsule that enables you to travel back and rediscover where BBC Radio was at in the mid 1960's.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Such is the case for Howlett himself whose own time at the beeb commenced quite a few years later. "I was just a child listening at home to this stuff - a beatle baby," he says. Nevertheless, while researching the sessions he did talk to numerous people who had worked on them, and
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   from what they said, he deduced that, during the early to mid 60's, there had actually been a conscious decision among the BBC hierarchy to dispose of all the material.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "I spoke to Jeff Griffin who was here at the BBC, and he recalled a particular Head Of Department saying, 'This material is taking up too much room. we've got to get rid of it!' Today that may seem ludicrous, especially as Radio 1 has its own archive and we hang on to all our sessions. In fairness, there was so much live recording done in those days - because there weren't all that many records being played - that if they had kept absolutely everything, it would have got completely out of control. I mean. you didn't really need to keep the Northern Dance Orchestra performing Singing The Blues for the fifteenth time or whatever.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "On the other hand, The Beatles had certainly become a phenomenon within a very short space of time, and so you would have though that somebody would have though that somebody would have considered the recordings worth hanging onto for posterity. There again, I've also heard that the contracts made with performing artists back then contained a clause stating that session tapes should be destroyed after three months; possibly a Musicians Union rule that its members would then be required to return and make further recordings.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Nevertheless in spite of all the rules and regulations, some employees fortunately did have the foresight todisregard them, albeit that the task of tracking down and collating these remnants was anything but straightforward for Howlett and his colleagues. The beeb, you see, is a large corporate body with numerous arms that reach out to both the domestic and overseas markets, and as a result, it has several different archives in a variety of locations.
  </div>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   <b>
    <span style="font-size: large;">
     BACK TO THE ARCHIVE
    </span>
   </b>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Over the years, it's been a process of putting the Beatles archive back together really, as more and more stuff has come to light," says Howlett.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "For the series The Beeb's Lost Beatles Tapes, which included a lot of speech interviews from the timew as well as the tracks, we turned up quite a few things. One of the most exciting finds came from the BBC Transcription Department, which was originally set up to distribute programmes to far flung corners of the British Empire."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   During the 1960's, there was a radio show called Top Of The Pops - not to be confused with the television programme of the same name - hosted by Brian Matthew. This fitted onto two sides of a long playing disc and it featured Matthew presenting session tracks that had been recorded for various BBC programmes by groups such as the Hollie, The Swinging Blue Jeans.... and The Beatles.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The transcription discs were utilised as the source for some of the 1964 material on the Live At The BBC album," explains Howlett. "On 'Things We Said Today', for instance, you can hear Brian Matthew voicing-over some sort of introduction, and that's actually taken from a Top Of The Pops disc, because the original version without the voice-over doesn't exist.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "There can be no doubt that the shows were well recorded at the time. So it's just a question as to how well the material has lasted over the years and in what form. I can remeber George Martin (the album's Executive Producer) saying to me that a disc is quite a good storage medium and that he was quite happy to master from it. In fact when I was working on a series called Paul Simon's Songbook a few years ago I talked to (producer) Roy Halee about his re-mastering of the Simon and Garfunkel material and how the original master tapes were in a bad condition, having been played over and over again and not looked after. he was appalled at the state they were in, and said, 'if only they could find me a decent mintcopy of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water', at least I would be able to master from that!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So much for disc storage, yet within the BBC Transcription Department there is also a tape library, and it is here that the most exciting find was made for the 1988 series The Beeb's Lost Beatles Tapes. "We came across two ten-inch reels with 'The Beatles' on the spine," recalls Howlett. "One of these was a half-hour reel featuring them larking around for the '65 Christmas Show, (an edition of  Saturday Club on which the group did not perform any songs). They were being interviewed by Brian Matthew and doing a send up of (the then influential TV pop show) Juke Box Jury, and obviously another version was eventually edited down from this.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "At the same time, the other half-hour reel was similar in that it had been left running while the session was in process, but it also included them performing 'I Feel Fine' and 'She's A Woman'. It had false starts, takes which broke down half-way through, and talkback between the group and the control room. It was fascinating, and that was quite a find, because it's sort of a pre-master really. From it, a master would have been made - a track would have been dubbed down, edited or whatever".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It's weird how some things turn up. For instance, I've done a programme about the Rolling Stones' work at the Beeb. Some of their sessions are still missing, but one of those that is still around is probably the most interseting of all. In 1964, they performed tracks in front of a live audience that they never recorded for Decca. it was an experimantel stereo broadcast for the BBC, whereby they would broadcast one side of the stereo on the radio and the other side on the television (ie. stereophony). Then there were no television programmes in the early morning, and so they broadcast one side of the stereo on TV only and you would have to position your radio and your TV to get the stereo image! Now, that tape survived because it was of interest technically. You know, some engineer kept it because it was one of the first stereo broadcasts and not particularly because it featured the Rolling Stones".
  </div>

    <span style="font-size: large;">
     ALTERNATIVE SOURCES
    </span>
   </b>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Meanwhile, with regard to The Beatles' radio performances, contact with the original session producers yielded some more tapes, but there were still quite a few gaps to be filled. It was for this reason that contact also had to be made with some.... ahem, 'alternative sources'. Indeed,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   since the transmission of the 1988 series, the most recent and valuable discovery has been a recording that a member of the public made off his radio back on January 26, 1963. Now it should be pointed out that this kind of practice was, of course, highly illegal, but in the case of The Beatles sessions, the BBC have had to behavein a manner which could more aptly be described as bloody grateful rather than terribly annoyed, for it is thanks to some eager listeners - and not the hallowed vaults - that certain lost gems have been retreived.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The 1988 radio series was virtually completed just before it went out on the air", says Howlett, "but then when it did go out, some people phoned up and said that they has more tapes. Out of all of them one appeared to actually have some stuff that we didn't have, recorded all those years ago on his little Grundig. While it was too late for the series, I nevertheless kept his letter on file and got back in touch with him when this album project was imminent. he journeyed down to London with his five-inch reels, we went through them, and that's how 'Keep Your Hands Off My Baby' appeared on the album". Certainly, a good number of shows were originally broadcast by the BBC in what was then known as VHF, and so, if someone had a half-decent domestic tape recorder and took a direct feed from his radio, the result of his or her endeavours could well be usable, especially with the digital
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   technology now available to clean up such recordings. Peter Mew has been utilising the Sonic Solutions computer enhancement system for the past 5 years at Abbey Road. He first became involved in the Beatles project when work on the album started in earnest around the middle of 1992.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "After George Martin had chosen the tracks that would go on the record, they were passed over to me for de-noising, EQing, and all the rest of it," he says. "Over the peiod of two and a half years, the album went through various changes - running order changes, title changes and things like that. At each stage I had to re-edit and make adjustments, so that it still sounded OK. In fact, overall it must have gone through seven different versions, and so I can now sing almost every song off by heart!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The masters that the BBC had were in pretty reasonable shape, and they therefore needed much the same treatment that old studio tapes would need. From there, however, things went down the scale in terms of sound quality and some items required a lot more work. Coming from so many different sources, each track had its own problems, and so it wasn't like a normal studio job where you had a number of studio reductions which basically required noise reduction. Everything had to be approached as a separate entity, and then, having done that, it was a matter of trying to get continuity of sound, and that worked in some cases and probably not in others!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Undoubtedly, the greatest attraction of the 56 song Live At The BBC album is the 30 numbers which the band never recorded; mostly old rock'n'roll covers from thier Hamburg and Cavern Club days, as well as a few contemporary hits and even one of their own compositions, 'I'll Be On My Way', which was a hit for Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas. Again, as with Little Eva's 'Keep Your Hands Off My Baby', several of these performances returned the BBC's way courtesy of private recordings, yet in a good number of cases they also came from the Transcription Library at Kensington House, but from Bush House, where the World Service programmes are broadcast.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The show, Pop Go The Beatles, was broadcast in the summer of 1963 on the domestic service," explains Kevin Howlett. "It featured a guest group and and a presenter and The Beatles reading requests, but it was then re-made for the BBC World Service and put out in '64 featuring just the songs and an announcer, and so that material went over to Bush House. Now, somebody over there made a tape of the more unusual songs, and due to this I was able to get hold of some of the most interesting tracks".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Still, there are half a dozen Beatles performances of 'unreleased' numbers which George Martin deemed as unsuitable for the album: Roy Orbisin's 'Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)', from their very first radio broadcast on March 8, 1962 (featuring Pete Best on drums); The Coasters' arrangement of 'Besame Mucho' and Joe Brown's 'A Picture Of You', both from June 15, 1962 (still with Best on drums); Slim Whitman's 'Beautiful Dreamer' from January 26, 1963; Chuck Berry's 'I'm Talking About You' from March 16, 1963; and Carl Perkins''Lend Me your Comb' from the broadcat of July 16, 1963.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Of these, the first five are audibly much too poor to bring up to scratch for the album - listeners' recordings that were evidently not made via direct feed into a good quality grundig, but rather with a cheap microphone placed next to the radio speaker while Mum was told to be quiet. In other words, items of historic importance that are not quite fit for general public consumption. yet the reason for omitting 'Lend Me Your Comb', which originates from the BBC's Bush House archive, is altogether less obvious.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Officially George Martin's selection criteria for the material involved both technical quality and the standard of the performance, and on thelatter count the number just missed the mark. Unofficially, the powers that be may also wish to keep something in the can, and thus have somthing in reserve to use as a 'bonus track' enticement for some future release along with all of the alternate takes.

     DROPOUTS AND MAGIC WANDS
    </b>
   </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The Roling Stones only did about 12 sessions, and so the fact that The Beatles did 52 is absolutely phenomenal", says Kevin Howlett. "They really worked at it, and of course, they were playing live in the studio, although by '64 they did get a bit more sophisticated. They certainly
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   didn't have a multitrack machine at their disposal. The first multitrack to come into the BBC was an eight-track, and that was a very long time after The Beatles had stopped doing sessions here. So, the only way that they could overdub was to put down a backing track and then play the tape back through the mixing desk and perform over the top of it. You can occasionally hear examples of this on some of their '64 recordings.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   30 years later one of the problems which peter mew had to deal with, especially when working on some of the rarer recordings, was that of sound dropouts. For, whilst he was able to repair most of them, a close listen to the album indicates that there were still a few instances wher this was just not possible.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The art, if you like, of using computer editing systems these days is that they allow you to take very small slithers of sound from elsewhere and patch them in, much like you would with a painting," mew explains. "But if you can't find a matching piece of sound from somewhere else in the song, then you just can't do it, because you obviously don't want to apply any new paint!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On 'A Taste Of Honey', for instance, there's an analogue dropout that has bugged me from the word go, but I couldn't do anything about it, because that piece of sound wasn't repeated anywhere else in the song. I also couldn't boost it, because it's not a particular level that drops for a particular length of time; it might drop a little bit here and then go up and down, and it's too long to restore using the click removal devices,which work on several milliseconds of sound. This dropout lasts for perhaps half a second and so you can't use the computer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So, at the end of the day, contrary to what some people think, the Sonic Solutions system is not a magic wand. It's a piece of technology, and if you've got absolute garbage going in, then you'll have something better than absolute garbage coming out, but it ain't going to be perfect".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Anyway, in the case of The Beatles, Live At The BBC album, who really cares? This is vintage stuff and it serves to remind one that, in the final analysis, musical content is of far more importance to the average listener than sheer sonic quality.

     SPOTTING TALENT
    </span>
   </b>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian Willey produced the December 4, 1962 and January 29, 1963 editions of The Talent Spot on which the Beatles first performed before a live audience. The first of these, recorded on November 27, 1962 at the BBC's Paris Theatre in Central London, featured the soon-to-be fab Four at the bottom of a star spangled bill comprising The Ted Taylor Four, Mark Tracey, Elkie Brooks, and Frank Kelly. Still, it served as a showcase for new talent and broke the mould in as much as no audition was required. In effect, therefore, it was like a broadcast audition.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Willey now recalls that after the first show, Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, "asked me, 'Do you like them?' and I said 'Well, they're rough, but they entertain me.' Bearing in mind that it was a live broadcast, a one-take job, they didn't do too badly. Epstein then asked me if I would have them back on the show. I said 'Yes', and by the time that happened, a few weeks later, they had already climbed the charts, and infact, made a hell of a difference to my audience. This usually consisted of about 30 or 40 people, and now, suddenly, hundreds were packing the Paris and queueing outside on the street".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Full-scale Beatlemania was looming just ahead and the band's phenomenal rise to superstardom was underway. Yet it is only with hindsight thatthose who were involved in this story can fully appreciate the significance of what they took part in all those years ago. "Looking backthey were great days", says Brian Willey, "but at the time, I was just doing a job, and I'm sure that none of us ever thought we were making amark on history.

   Starting to circulate among collectors is a new, free 24 disc set of Beatles material from BBC Radio. The set is designed to accompany Kevin Howlett's book The Beatles: The BBC Archives 1962-1970. Each disc can be stored in a separate case, or they can be placed in slim cases and housed in the box intended for the book. They will fit in the UK box, not in the US one, because that box was a bit smaller. The set includes every known surviving BBC radio music and interview appearance from 1962-1970, plus guest appearances by other acts, and (as bonus items) interviews with those involved in the sessions. The sessions are arranged chronologically, with several Special Editions including the complete 5th birthday Saturday Club, The Beatles Abroad, all of the group's appearances on the Top Of The Pops radio series up to 1970, the BBC Beatles Night in December 1963, and even a DVD of their surviving BBC TV appearances.

   All tracks have been pulled from the best possible sources including original transcription discs and tapes. Dropouts, mains hum and other annoyances have been carefully removed. Noise reduction has not been used, however it is present on some of the tracks, because noise reduction was used on the releases they are sourced from. Early fades have all been fixed where possible. This has been a huge undertaking, and I am sure the people behind it have spent years of research and audio enhancement work to accomplish such a comprehensive set. These are probably the dedicated and knowledgable fans who should have been trusted to master the Beatles' own official BBC recordings albums... A number of upgrades are included, plus some previously unheard guest appearances. And as a special bonus, a selection of never before heard continuity from the Light Program and Home Service is included, giving a bird's eye view into the hilariously stuffy state of British radio in the early 1960s.

   The makers of this amazing collection are not doing it for profit, but because they feel all of The Beatles BBC material should be out there for fans to enjoy and historians to scrutinise. In fact, the set is distributed as free download links, and the people behind it are is are encouraging the fans to continue to distribute this set freely before it gets picked up and distributed for profit by the real bootleggers. They are also encouraging everyone to buy Kevin Howlett's book, not only to get the box to house the collection, but also because it's a vital piece of the BBC puzzle and will enable everyone to put the audio discs into context.  They are also asking people to support the artist and buy the official BBC albums. As they say: This is a fan project, not a bootleg. Don't charge money for copies.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   If you have any of the previous releases of the material, like the one from Purple Chick (an earlier non-profit Beatles BBC project), this is a huge update, both regarding upgrades of songs, chat, intros and outtros as well as newly unearthed material. And if you have managed to get hold of the 2010 "Unsurpassed Broadcasts" series, this one surpasses it, both in volume and because it contains material that has been found since then. The set covers the same period that Howlett's book covers, so it goes all the way to 1970, whereas older BBC sets come to a halt after The Beatles' final original music performances in 1965. Doug Sulpy calls this set "core" in his latest issue of The 910, in fact he even hints that it may be too comprehensive! The one thing is, if you want discs, you have to burn them yourself, and the same goes for the artwork, you'll have to print it out.

If you have not bought Kevin's excellent book yet then show your support by doing so, and as a bonus you'll have a nice box to house the set in (note: purchase the UK version of the book, not the US version which is smaller and will not fit the discs). Everyone doubtless by now owns On Air, but if not then please also show your support by snapping up a copy.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It is quite remarkable that we have recordings of The Beatles' very first radio broadcasts with Pete Best. This is entirely down to the efforts of local fan Mike Adams, who faithfully taped their radio appearances throughout 1962 and 1963. Though very low fidelity, they provide enough clarity to get a good idea of how the group sounded in that vital intervening period between the Decca audition in January and the arrival of Ringo in August. They show a Beatles with increasing confidence and originality, as well as highlighting stylistic changes: by the time of the June broadcast, Paul has ditched the Elvis overtones which characterised his singing at Decca and remained through to the time of the first broadcast.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The debut Saturday Club would have been a huge deal for the group as it was undisputably the top radio programme for teenagers in the early 1960s. Aside from their two current singles, they chose to do two songs from their Helen Shapiro tour: Keep Your Hands Off My Baby and Beautiful Dreamer, the latter a virtual note for note copy of Tony Orlando's version. By this time a number of people were taping and keeping The Beatles radio broadcasts. Aside from Mike Adam's tape there were also recordings made by Stuart Leaver and (reputedly though it has never been verified) Liverpool recording booth owner Percy Phillips at the request of Briasn Epstein. The BBC of course wiped the tape some time after broadcast, as they did with all their recordings, the union agreements entitling them to a single use only.

   The second Saturday Club is also an event, The Beatles' performance being transmitted literally live from a small talks studio. They rocked in their best foot-stomping nightclub style for this show, turning in some truly electrifying performances. The story goes that a tape of the broadcast was made from the studio feed by BBC staff and given to John Lennon, but if it has survived the years then it has left no trace of itself.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The final Here We Go show is interesting, even though the performances are a bit lightweight. This is the first high quality recording of the group before an audience we have, and already there are hints from the audience of the female hysteria which was to come.

   Some great sessions here. John turns in a completely mental performance of Twist And Shout at the Albert Hall, Paul gets to unleash Long Tall Sally on the unsuspecting millions, an orphaned Lennon-McCartney composition has its one and only airing, and listeners are able to tune into The Beatles' own radio series for the first time. Also some recollections from George Harrison and Terry Henebery, who don't quite see eye to eye on some matters.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Side By Side was a vehicle for folkies The Karl Denver Trio to display their versatility while playing host to another group each week. The visiting group would join in with the opening rendition of the old time classic Side By Side, and then the two groups would take the spotlight alternately one song at a time. The Beatles three visits resulted in moments of great hilarity along with some surprisingly serious interviews and a handful of precious rarities. The obvious jewell in the collection is I'll Be On my Way, a s ong of Paul's that John never liked and which was eventually fobbed off onto Billy J. Kramer. However with The Beatles usual tasteful treatment it manages to be charming and memorable despite its lightweight content. The third SBS show has been presented here almost in its entirety thanks to a newly discovered tape found in the collection of a Karl Denver fan. It features not only all the songs TKDT performed that day but also a Beatles performance of Love Me Do unheard by the world at large since the day it was broadcast over 50 years ago. It's a great rendition, and is distinguished by a full rounded ending - the only studio recording of this song to have one.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mostly Pop Go The Beatles this time. Music and chat for episodes 2 and 3 was pre-recorded the same day (with ep3 first), but there are indicators here that like many BBC shows the actual broadcast was a mixture of session tapes and live links. In episode 3, Lee Peters apologises for having gotten Ringo's birthday wrong in episode 2 and mentions fans writing in to correct him, something that obviously could not happen if both shows were completely pre-recorded. This happens at other times in the series too. It might also explain why when the series was aired on the World Service in 1964, new narration needed to be provided by another announcer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   While Lee Peters proves to be quite witty, he makes a few snide remarks here and there which makes one wonder whether The Beatles had him booted out and replaced in the next series. In a later volume Paul relates a story about how they arrived at the studio early one day to find the staff all listening to jazz in the control room. So there may have been a bit of jazz snobbery going on.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   These shows also showcase The Beatles' great sense of humour, and some of the links are as good as the best BBC Radio comedy of the time. This added greatly to the entertainment value of the shows and is something that their contemporaries could not match.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A few guest appearances by other artists show just how far removed The Beatles were from their contemporaries at this time. An unintentionally funny moment comes when Carter Lewis is obliged to omit the word "damn" from the line "I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar", such was the BBC's stuffiness. For those of a rigid moral nature, more sustenance can be found in track 57.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Some great performances here. Presented for the first time is a near-complete version what is widely regarded as their best ever BBC appearance, that for PGTB episode 5. Included is a cracking guest appearance from keyboard virtuoso Graham Bond, with Ginger Baker (later of Cream) on drums. It's interesting to compare their BBC versions of I Got A Woman and I Saw Her Standing There to The Beatles, a world apart but each with their own merits. The embryonic R&amp;B scene would soon explode into public awareness so it's cool to see Merseybeat and R&amp;B alongside each other at this early stage. PGTB 5 also marks Rodney Burke's debut as announcer, but he seems to think the audience was mostly under 5s.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the end of the disc Paul and Ringo share some interesting recollections about the sessions.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Nothing but Pop Go The Beatles this time. Incredibly three of these sessions were recorded in one go - July 16th - which blows away their previous effort of recording the Please Please Me album in one day. A consequence of this is that they recorded very little chat that day and shows 9 and 10 have no Beatle chat at all, prompting indignant letters from listeners. Once again there are indications that Rodney Burke's links were actually live - during track 53 he mentions many people writing in to request She Loves You, which had not yet been released on July 16th.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The complete guest appearance by Russ Sainty exists, but only two of his numbers would fit on this disc. The other three are contained in a separate folder. If you are not burning to disc then simply copy these into the main folder. This is one of only two shows (the other being 5) for which we have almost the entire half hour.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Countless minor cosmetic repairs have been made as usual but I won't go into these, suffice to say that if I've done my job properly you shouldn't notice anything. I will just comment that Long Tall Sally is the unedited version - on the official release there are some notes edited during the first guitar solo.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A real assortment here. We start off with Saturday Club, featuring another great vocal from Paul on Long Tall Sally and a real lively version of Glad All Over, so very different to the one they'd recorded two weeks earlier. If anyone knows what the little ditty before You Really Got A Hold On Me is called then please speak up! Apologies for the dreadful sound quality of track 3 - do not adjust your radio sets.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Ooh! My Soul is the complete unedited version, unlike the official releases which were cut to ribbons. Long John Baldry makes a guest appearance and would later return in the Around The Beatles TV special. Baldry was one of the circle of R&amp;B afficionados which included Alexis Korner, The Rolling Stones etc. This show (and the next) are notable for a change in recording technique with much louder drums and bass than before. This is possibly down to a change in producer (Ian Grant) and engineer (Keith Bateson). She Loves You (which would have been track 19) is sadly unavailable at this time, one of only two songs missing from the Pop Go The Beatles series (the other being the very first song broadcast). A snippet of a version was included on the Yellow Dog set but it is the wrong version (from 16th July). A copy exists but sadly the owner would not release it for use in this set.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   PGTB from 3rd September includes a couple of upgrades probably unfamiliar to many people (I'll Get You and Money) plus upgrades of three tracks by Brian Poole, who gets to perform Twist And Shout "with permission of course". There's also some unbooted links from Rodney Burke (including the stock lame jokes). There's A Place was apparently recorded for this show but in any event the recording from July 2nd was used for the broadcast. Why exactly this happened is anybody's guess.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the end are The Beatles contributions to The Mersey Sound TV special, including a great upgrade of She Loves You unearthed recently. Two different versions of Twist And Shout were also performed, plus a rather amateurish sounding instrumental.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The show "Two Way Favourites" was a vehicle for listeners to request records for their relatives in the armed forces. John did a cheeky parody of this during the 1965 Beatles Christmas record.

   The last three Pop Go The Beatles, once again all recorded in one day and totalling a whopping 18 separate performances (She Loves You was only recorded once), their greatest ever marathon session. Also they somehow managed to find time to record extensive chat. Amazing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Episode 13 for some reason had 7 Beatle numbers instead of the usual 6. Till There Was You has never circulated before, and can be heard here for the first time in over 50 years! The quality is not as good as the other tracks but is still interesting, very similar to the Royal Variety performance except with the high notes at the end (the last time Paul ever sang it this way). The rest of the tracks from these three shows appear in their best ever quality, with all the bass distortion and limiting gone. They really sound wild on a few of these tracks and were clearly enjoying themselves. A few segments of unbooted chat are included.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This Saturday Club was the 5th birthday edition and was recorded live as a keepsake by producer Bernie Andrews, explaining the sterling sound quality. The whole two hour show will feature on a subsequent volume, but here are The Beatles segments. Memphis is the full unedited version. For the commercial release the intro from the PGTB 7 performance was tacked on the front to remove the voiceover.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the end is the performance from The Ken Dodd Show, which strangely had screaming teenage girls present - not Ken's usual audience! One can only guess that news of The Beatles' scheduled appearance leaked out in advance.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Flowerpot Men was a popular children's puppet TV show, the closing song from which began "Goodbye Bill, Goodbye Ben".

  44 - Roll Over Beethoven (Alternate recording of December 17)

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With Pop Go The Beatles now history, the BBC sessions became more of an opportunity to plug their records which, by and large, were barely heard on the Beeb. There were still precious few shows that would actually play rock and roll records and so these live sessions were the only chance groups had to plug them. Which is great for us, but it must have been frustrating for them.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There was so much concern about The Beatles' safety during this Easybeat session that Brian Epstein banned them from doing any more radio sessions with audiences. The Peter Woods interview is hilarious, although oddly enough they repeated it almost word for word on film a few minutes later (which you'll see on the final volume). The Public Ear was a magazine style show which the group enjoyed listening to, and there's some interesting interviews that go beyond the usual questions about haircuts. Pete Best even gets a chance to grumble about his lot, something he would eventually turn into a full blown career :lol: If The Beatles heard this particular episode, this would have been the first time they became aware of his feelings. This show was picked up by the BBC Transcription Service for overseas sale on disc, which explains why it still exists.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Saturday Club is a good one with plenty of witty banter, including an upgrade of IWTHYH shared on youtube a couple of years back and overlooked on the official set. The medley is fun. Sometimes it gets credited as "Shazam" but the similarity is probably unintentional. She Loves You is the same recording as from the birthday edition, for reasons unknown.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Rolf Harris first met the group at the Swinging Sound 63 broadcast heard on V2 (he can be heard at the very end after From Me To You). It seems they got along well although according to his biography he was sometimes on the receiving end of practical jokes during the Christmas Show at the Astoria. With their usual good cheer they join in with his biggest hit, showing their versatility and ability to come off well no matter how peculiar or artificial the circumstances. This show now sounds better than ever. I Want To Hold Your Hand is the unedited version. On the official BBC set the second middle section (from "and when I touch you" up to "yeh you got that something") is cut out and replaced with a copy of the first, losing Paul's harmony and rather spoiling the song.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the end is an incomplete superior alternate source for track 21. Unfortunately the guy taping (the same one who taped track 19) wasn't that interested and changed the station midway through the song, before returning once more and then switching off before the end. The missing bits are pasted in from another source.

   We head into 1964 now and Beatlemania moves up a gear. George and Ringo make a brief contribution to The Public Ear, and then it's an on-the-spot report of the US arrival for Saturday Club. This must have seemed like a dream to listeners in the UK as their success in America was unprecedented. The Beatles sound stunned and overwhelmed in their phone interview with Brian Matthew. Brian for his part seems tickled pink that the group he'd championed for the past year was now the greatest attraction in the world.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Before they left for the US they also taped a music session for Saturday Club which timed in nicely with news of their Stateside success. Like their previous appearances they plugged their current records but also threw in a couple of unreleased numbers, this time a peppy version of The Hippy Hippy Shake (surely performed to put The Swinging Blue Jeans in their place) and a laid back four in the bar treatment of Johnny B. Goode, which seems to go awry during the guitar solo. The recording of I Want To Hold Your Hand was reused from their December appearance. Another phone interview follows, and then some more entertaining contributions to The Public Ear, a show which they particpated in eagerly it would seem.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The second From Us To You special was the first Beatles music session to be picked up by the BBC Transcription Service, who reformatted it and pressed it onto a one-sided disc for overseas radio stations. Here it has been re-edited into its original sequence with the missing parts restored. The show used an identical format to Saturday Club, with prerecorded sessions and records played into a live broadcast presided over by Alan Freeman, thus the comment about Can't Buy Me Love being number one in the charts. The theme song is a new recording, not the one from the first special. These are exceptionally good performances, every one of them of releasable quality. As Alan Freeman notes, it was extraordinary that they could get these together so quickly.

   The Beatles are the undisputed kingpins of the pop world by now, and the Beeb has to fight for their spare time just like everyone else. But they remain committed to Saturday Club, the programme they grew up with as teenagers, and in March turn in a very interesting session indeed.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This rendition of Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby is so totally different to the one put down for Pop Go The Beatles a year earlier, and really highlights the shift in The Beatles' sound away from flat-out dance hall music to a more laid back style. Paul's bass really pumps and George's newly acquired twelve string Rickenbacker gives this song and the others on this session a really unique sound. John performs the only other known rendition of I Call Your Name but doesn't seem quite sure of the words. He makes up for it in full with a screaming version of I Got A Woman, once again so totally different to the Pop Go The Beatles version. This shows that The Beatles took these sessions seriously - they must have found time to rearrange it in a different style since it's unlikely they'd performed it since their previous recording. This track like several others has double tracked vocals, a technique they were virtually addicted to by now. Sure To Fall was obviously one of their favourite songs, and here features for the first time the same "ska" reggae beat in the middle section that they'd recently used on I Call Your Name. Long Tall Sally has changed from the fast version with a skip drum beat that they did all through 1963 to a four-in-the-bar treatment they would keep from now on. Evidence once again that The Beatles didn't just pump out the same old sounds over and over like some critics claimed. They were constantly reinventing themselves.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The third From Us To You is another interesting session, with four numbers that had not yet appeared on record. I Forgot To Remember is a rare gem indeed for 1964, with George showing an increasing fondness for country guitar sounds. Honey Don't is still sung by John, although by now it incorporates Carl Perkins' walking lead guitar part that was missing from their previous rendition. And Ringo turns in one of his rare BBC vocals on Matchbox, sounding particularly eager.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Top Gear was the first of a new generation of "with it" pop programmes that dispensed with the jazz and middle of the road and concentrated on live sessions with a rock flavour. Unlike Saturday Club, it was on late at night after the kiddies had gone to bed and was squarely aimed at a more mature teenage audience. The Beatles appeared on the debut show and turned in a great session, with interesting electrified versions of And I Love Her and If I Fell. A Hard Day's Night was for some reason edited to incorporate the solo from the actual record. Why exactly this was done has never been satisfactorily explained. This edition was excerpted in part in the debut edition of "Top Of The Pops" - not the tv show of the same name but a special series created by the BBC Transcription Service. The one hour radio show was hosted by Brian Matthew and contained only live BBC sessions, which were pressed onto disc and circulated across the globe. Running to literally hundreds of editions, it would preserve for posterity many of these valuable sessions throughout the sixties and beyond. A copy of the Top Gear broadcast was also kept by producer Bernie Andrews, which accounts for the existence of the remaining tracks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Finally there is an extract from the recording session for the final From Us To You. How exactly this survives is unknown, but perhaps a copy was kept by one of the studio staff. Sadly very little material of this sort seems to exist.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Track 47 provides a glimpse into the Light Programme's habit of playing random BBC sessions after midnight. Since these were never logged there is no way of knowing what was played, but it's not hard to imagine that some Beatles sessions got another airing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Around this time Pop Go The Beatles was also revived for airing on the General Overseas Service (aka BBC World Service), although the guests artists were discarded and new links recorded. Only episodes 11-15 of the original PGTB series were mined (the rest had probably already been erased); two more runs under the same title would follow with material mined from Top Gear, Saturday Club and Ticket To Ride. Frustratingly, since the GOS transmitted from London using tape rather than disc, they would appear not to have survived.

   The music sessions are starting to wind down now. We have the fourth and final From Us To You, which has a couple of notable rarities in the form of I'm Happy Just To Dance With You and I Should Have Known Better. The former has an amusing gender bending slip up by George, while the latter highlights John's occasional harmonica playing. Also included is Cilla's BBC version of the Lennon-McCartney number It's For You, with an interesting use of harmonium. George continues to use his new 12 string Rickenbacker as he did for most sessions around this time.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The second and last Top Gear session is a particularly good one, with some classy performances equal to and perhaps even surpassing the EMI versions. This show also features plenty of witty banter and was mined almost in full (topical and local references were removed) for several editions of the Top Of The Pops radio series. The version of Honey Don't presented here is the Transcription Services edit; the full (poorer quality) version is included as an extra (track 41).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Interestingly, four of the Top Gear recordings also found their way into Saturday Club a month later. Perhaps this isn't surprising given that the same team made both programmes, but it is disappointing that they didn't record these numbers again. However there is more great chat to make up for it. Like Top Gear, this final Saturday Club was also plundered for Top Of The Pops.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The live Pop Inn interview only exists because it was taped and kept by the producer. Keith Fordyce also presented the TV show Ready Steady Go and so was well acquainted with The Beatles. Here they chat from the set of Help! and throw in an amusing improvised version of the jazz standard Hold That Tiger (Tiger Rag).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Finally we have some extracts from the second Top Gear recording session. I Feel Fine features the longest and most complete preamble yet, and reveals John having difficulty recreating the feedback noise at the start of the song. The take that follows is not the same as the one that they chose to overdub more vocals onto for the finished show. After that we hear some studio chat that preceded the finished take of She's A Woman, with Paul inciting the others to get it right. This session tape was found in the Transcription Services library in the late 80s, where it had been left over from the production of Top Of The Pops (Transcription Service preferred to work from session tapes rather than broadcast tapes). Another session tape still exists and was owned by Bernie Andrews up until shortly before his death in 2009. This tape contains takes of Honey Don't and I'll Follow The Sun, and a short excerpt of the latter song is featured here from a copy that turned up at auction (complete with a pretty dodgy cover story).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The very first track appears to be an out-take from either the 17th or 25th November sessions. This was included as a teaser at the start of one of the Top Of The Pops radio episodes.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   We're now halfway through the set and up to the last Beatles BBC music session. Although they would continue be interviewed on radio over the next five years, their music would soon become too complex to reproduce in a three hour BBC session. Aside from this, the advent of pirate radio stations free from restrictions on playing records meant that, strictly speaking, BBC radio was no longer essential to The Beatles' homeland success.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Their last bank holiday special bore a different and rather cumbersome title but was otherwise identical in format to the four From Us To You shows. The guests included The Lorne Gibson Trio (who had appeared in two Pop Go The Beatles episodes), The Ivy League and The Hollies (whom John despised but one of the most popular British bands of the time). The Beatles' contribution is good but engineer Keith Bateson (who had worked on Pop Go The Beatles) recalls that by this stage the novelty was starting to wear off and he wasn't surprised when they never returned. The Hollies turn in a terrific set, including a roaring version of the old rock classic Stay. John plays electric keyboard on The Night Before, the only other occasion on which they performed this song, and Paul overdubs some onto Dizzy Miss Lizzy. Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby and Honey Don't both benefit from some nifty Chet Atkins inspired guitar work from George, providing more evidence of The Beatles continuing musical development.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Top Of The Pops interview was specially recorded for that show and bundled together with material from the last few music sessions. It is not known exactly where or when this was taped. The mention of Buckingham Palace is interesting - perhaps the news hadn't been announced when this conversation took place, since it is difficult to imagine Brian Matthew failing to mention it otherwise. Was George dropping a hint?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The World Of Books illustrates the difference in the BBC's approach to interviewing to that of the other media. Whereas the newspapers were content to ask banal questions about hairstyles, the BBC wanted to probe deeper. John is clearly delighted to be taken seriously for once and reveals quite a lot about his thought processes and influences. This is the longest version of this interview to ever appear.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Pop Profile was another Transcription Service series pressed onto disc for overseas broadcasters. All four Beatles were interviewed separately and once again were served up more probing questions than the type they were accustomed to. These are the complete (albeit brief) episodes. The official release omitted the theme music.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The last track is an early sighting of a man who would become a key feature of The Beatles BBC radio output in the future.

   We kick off this time with the Fabs' Christmas Day 1965 appearance on Saturday Club, although it had been recorded almost a month earlier. This isn't the actual broadcast but rather the unedited session tape which was discovered at the Transcription Service library in the late 80s. This is really classic stuff as The Beatles take off Juke Box Jury, their Cavern fans, and deliver an accapella version of the Saturday Club theme. This version is longer than any that has previously appeared, and now includes some fascinating fly-on-the-wall material where The Beatles discuss amongst themselves their rehearsal plans for the upcoming UK tour, as well as other matters.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The next day John and George recorded their Pop Profile interviews, which were included on the previous volume. A good six months later it was Paul and Ringo's turn. Ringo sounds a little lost, but the Paul interview reveals the changes in attitude and taste that he was going through at this time. The same morning they had all recorded an appearance for the 400th edition of Saturday Club, and while they did not sing they had much of interest to say, with George revealing that it is Paul playing guitar on Paperback Writer, "trying to sound like Jeff Beck". Brian Matthew gently needles them about not being as accessible as they used to be, prompted by the fact that their UK media appearances had dwindled alarmingly in 1966. This interview was also edited down and distributed by the BBC Transcription Service, but the missing sections have been restored here from off air tapes.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The interview with Paul by David Frost is another revealing insight into the major changes in attitude that were affecting all the Beatles at this time. Unfortunately the same can't be said for The Lennon &amp; McCartney Songbook which was an ill-conceived attempt to pander to "serious" music audiences by highlighting all the non-pop artists who had covered their songs. John plainly thought it was a stupid idea and derailed the interview by being uncooperative, while Paul seemed flattered but still a little suspicious. The interview with producer Derek Chinnery confirms that it hadn't really worked out the way he'd planned. It was Chinnery who taped and preserved this programme for posterity, but it was also taken up as usual by the Transcription Service who whittled it down and gave it a new title. Both versions are included here.

  13 - Raw inerview Tape
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A bizarre greeting from John for The Kenny Everett Show kicks off today's collection. Then it's over to the prestigious Ivor Novello Awards with John and Paul and their old friend Brian Matthew, who also returned to Abbey Road with them to record a short interview for his Top Of The Pops radio series. Here they make it perfectly clear that the old order is gone and they are now purely a studio band, an extraordinary development considering their extensive touring schedule throughout the previous years. Brian seems somewhat bemused and puzzled by this new attitude, but takes it in his stride and goes along with the Beatle humour which is still very much unchanged.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Next up is the first of many appearances with Kenny Everett, the zany radio pioneer who had defected to the BBC from offshore pirate station Radio London. Radio 1 replaced the old Light Programme and was modelled squarely on the format set by the pirates and US stations across the Atlantic, except of course that there was no advertising. The Beatles felt right at home with Kenny's offbeat sense of humour and unconventional attitude, and these are undoubtedly the weirdest free-form interviews they would ever put down on tape. Kenny was particularly fond of creating radio jingles for his programmes, so for Where It's At he joined Paul at the piano in a little ditty that went "Kenny Everett and Chris Denning, all together on the wireless machine", which was frequently used to plug the show. Occasionally doubt has been cast over the authenticity of this track, with some suggesting that Kenny actually performed it alone, however the matter is settled here beyond any reasonable doubt: at the end of track 16 Chris Denning can clearly be heard to say, "Come on, sing Paul!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Scene And Heard was a magazine style series which would prominently feature The Beatles during their later years and serve a valuable role in documenting their ever changing attitudes. The first appearances were by George and Ringo, who gave listeners the lowdown on Magical Mystery Tour and their views on life. George is suddenly deeply immersed in religion, something that of course would continue to shape his life from now on.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Another important radio pioneer was John Peel, who would take over the hosting of Top Gear and play an important role in breaking many new British bands. In December 1968 John brought his new love interest Yoko Ono onto his late night show Night Ride and they discussed various matters and played some of John's favourite records, as well as airing for the first (and only?) time a long extract from their Two Virgins lp (omitted here for the sake of listener sanity!)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Lastly is one of Everett's raw interview tapes recorded at Abbey Road studios, and another appearance of Paul's jingle. The ditty "Goodbye Kenny, see you in the morning" which Ringo sings is based on the Butlins goodnight jingle, "Goodnight campers, see you in the morning". Ringo must have heard this many times when he played there.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Now at the end of the long and winding road we suddenly have three volumes worth of interviews from 1969-70. David Wigg from Scene And Heard interviewed the individual Beatles extensively during this time and caught on tape their opinions on most everything including their future together. Although the original shows are long gone, Wigg issued some of his tapes on vinyl in the 1970s and lots more were preserved in the Top Of The Pops radio series. This has allowed them to be recontructed using off air tapes as a template. Also featured is another of John's weird Kenny Everett interviews and Paul talking on Radio Merseyside (the BBC recently having been granted permission to establish local radio networks).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The thing that struck me about these interviews is that while it's apparent they've all developed outside interests, there seems to be no indication of The Beatles coming to an end and plenty of optimism about the future. Even George says - in March 1969 - that he "can see The Beatles sticking together forever". And John - post Get Back fiasco - says that he hopes The Beatles will make another film!

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Well, all good things come to and end... at least for the moment. Here are the last handful of Beatles BBC interviews before the breakup. Scene And Heard continued to document the state of play until the very end, probing deeper than any Beatles interviews had ever done before. Conspicuous in his absence is Paul, who seems to have been growing ever more estranged from the public and the other three at this time. Not long after Ringo's Open House appearance, Paul would finally bring down the curtain on The Beatles for good.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As usual these interviews have been reconstructed where possible using new improved sources. Before anyone asks, there was another BBC special in 1970 about Let It Be, but this merely repackaged Scene And Heard interviews along with music from the lp. Since it was broadcast after the breakup, it falls outside the scope of this set.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The final track documents the occasion when Paul McCartney gave his blessing for this set. Though it has taken over 40 years to assemble, it is proudly presented here as a historical and cultural artifact. Thanks Paul... and John, George and Ringo.

   This is the first of two discs featuring the 5th birthday edition of Saturday Club, taped for posterity by producer Bernie Andrews. Almost the whole two hours is here, save for the news break halfway through and perhaps one other song. It's a great insight into what it was like to be a British teenager in 1963 and just how different The Beatles were from all their contemporaries. The trad jazz boom was on its last legs but still had enough followers to warrant regular intrusions by the likes of Kenny Ball and Clinton Ford. There's a nice live sessions by The Everly Brothers, Frank Ifield and Joe Brown. Also recorded congratulations from many people including some from across the pond in America, who had no idea of what was coming in just a few short months.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   30 minutes from Saturday Club was also fed live into the World Service each week, so the show also had followers in many other parts of the world. Amazingly in early 1963 The Beatles received a request from a listener in Egypt (!)

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   We momentarily switch our attention to The Beatles BBC TV output. This night was a real coup for The Beatles: a whole hour of prime evening television to themselves. Quite extraordinary for a group that only a year before had been playing in a dive in Hamburg's red light district.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Both programmes were recorded the same afternoon at the Liverpool Empire before members of the fan club. The Juke Box Jury special is a great listen as it reveals them talking at length about the one thing they were most passionate about: music. Even if they didn't really like most of the records chosen, their views on what is commercial and why are fascinating. There are also plenty of funny moments, like where John puts his foot in it by panning The Orchids, only to be told afterwards that they are sitting in the audience. He recovers the situation with typical Lennon humour. It's just a shame that we can't see what is going on because like nearly all BBC tv programmes of the era it was uncerimoniously wiped after transmission. However this is a new off air recording discovered during the "Treasure Hunt" campaign in 2004 and has not been heard till now. The quality is great and has been further improved here by dubbing in the original records.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The concert appearance was controversial at the time because of the perceived poor techical quality. The camera work was mediocre and reportedly featured only one single close up of John in the entire show. Ringo's mic remained totally dead throughout his number, and many viewers said there were too many shots of the audience. There's an account of The Beatles watching the broadcast in their dressing room in a state of dismay, with Paul commenting that if he was someone unfamiliar with The Beatles then he'd wonder what anyone saw in them.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Luckily they still turned in a great performance, although once again the videotape was not archived. However it was innadvertantly preserved in part by being selected as a training tape for enginners to practice physical edits on. Gradually over the years the precious master was whittled away by apprentice technicians, until only parts of only four songs remained, plus a short reel of audience shots. The first poor quality boots of the complete soundtrack appeared in the 70s, and were all that was available until an in-line version appeared on youtube decades later. However even that version had severe wow and flutter and frequent loud clicks. A third tape has been freshly transferred for this set, and although it is incomplete (missing From Me To You, This Boy and the between-song chat) it has been restored and edited together with the youtube version to create the best sounding version of this concert ever (the only complete Beatles concert recording we have from 1963). The existing video clips will appear on the final volume.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Included as a bonus at the end are two solo Beatle appearances made for Juke Box Jury. John upset a lot of viewers with his forthright views, especially Elvis fans who didn't take kindly to their idol being likened to Bing Crosby. Even some of the fellow panelists sound a little taken aback by his comments. However, there is little doubt that he was actually correct in his views. At a time when the British hit parade was incredibly insipid, John's musical taste was way ahead of its time. George's appearance is far more lighthearted, although sadly only excerpts seem to survive. Ringo also made an appearance, but the existing recording is so poor as to be virtually inaudible.

  39 - Unused Raw Interviews
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With The Beatles no longer willing to do music sessions, the BBC was left to come up with this bank holiday special via their own resources. It weaved together interviews recorded by Brian Matthew during the first part of the 1965 US tour with The Beatles' own records. The interviews are quite interesting and capture their views on most aspects of life and also their impressions of the Shea Stadium concert. This complete version even includes the news break and has been restored by upgrading the music with better sources.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Also included is the Transcription Service version of the show, which omitted the music and concentrated soley on the interviews (although it omitted some of them). This is the version used in various retrospectives over the years, the master tape to the original broadcast being long gone. Following this are some unused interviews with Brian Matthew.

   This is another special edition documenting the group's appearances on the weekly radio series Top Of The Pops, aired in most places on earth except the UK.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Our old mate Brian Matthew is in charge, but those of you who listened to the complete Saturday Club will hardly recognise him here as he sounds like someone has slipped a couple of tubes of Prellies into his English Breakfast tea. These shows boasted the cream of British pop talent and preserved for posterity a huge chunk of the radio archive which would otherwise be gone forever, because fortunately the Transcription Service diligently kept a file copy of each disc in its library. Ex-radio station copies (along with hundreds of other TS discs) also regularly pop up on auction sites (try popspike if you're interested).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The shows consisted only of interviews and BBC sessions, which were mostly drawn from Saturday Club and Top Gear (which shared the same theme tune). The Beatles early appearances will be familiar to anyone who has followed the various incarnations of The Beatles At The Beeb retrospectives throughout the years, however here they are presented with the linking material by Brian Matthew intact. Once The Beatles stopped doing music sessions the show suffered a huge blow and lost its biggest draw card, however it continued to keep them in the limelight by including interviews recorded for Saturday Club and (on part 2) Scene And Heard. Show 42 is interesting as it actually plays the "darts" version of the song Help! from the film.

   This volume collects together material from Scene And Heard that was siphoned off for use in TOTP. Also included are two Dibbs Mather interviews from '64 and '65 not heard in the UK but included here because they are transcribed in Howlett's book. Of course, they are much funnier to hear than to read, which makes one wonder why they didn't include a cd of interviews with the book! Also included is a George Martin interview. Probably his earliest interview and therefore likely to be the most accurate.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Mersey Sound was included as audio on V6 but here you can actually watch it. Included are The Beatles parts only. It's The Beatles as I said only exists because it was used for editing practise and so there are lots of bits missing and you can see regular splices in the tape. The Grandstand segment is great, not just for the airport coverage but also the terrifically funny interview (and where Ringo actually uses his malapropism, "tomorrow never knows"). Panorama is a very interesting profile of Brian Epstein, including interviews with the amn himself which show just what a unique individual he was in a business largely populated by hucksters. Paul's interview with David Frost is intruiging, especially seeing him separated from the other three and faced with an adult audience. He seems very coy but has one or two interesting things to say about the songwriting. Not Only But Also from 1965 has some amusing material and shows that John, if he had not become a Beatle, could easily have fitted in with the new breed of British comedians who were storming the tv screens at this time. An interview for Tonight by contrast shows his more thoughtfull side, although at this early stage he still seems reluctant to take his work completely seriously. Our World is the complete B&amp;W version with the show introduction and spoken preamble, including the original live audio rarely heard when this clip is seen. The Release interview heralds the era in which John suddenly became far more vocal in his opinions and more willing to consider his work as serious art. It's nice to see him and Victor Spinetti together as Spinetti was a huge admirer of John and sang his praises at every opportunity.

  <br/>
  RECORDED: 07 March, 1962, 8:00 - 8:45 p.m.

  TRANSMITTED: 08 March, 1962, 5:00 - 5:29 p.m.
  <br/>
  ANNOUNCER: Ray Peters
  <br/>
  PRODUCER: Peter Pilbeam
  <br/>
  1. MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE BBC.01.01
  <br/>
  2. DREAM BABY BBC.01.02
  <br/>
  3. PLEASE MR. POSTMAN BBC.01.03
  <br/>
  Here We Go was a programme recorded before a live audience, and the Beatles took part in five shows. This is an absolutely essential session: their first radio broadcast, the first live show which has been preserved, the only Beatles recording of "Dream Baby", and the only live perfomances of "Memphis" and "Please Mr. Postman". Also, it is one of the very few available shows with Pete Best on drums.
  <br/>
  The group's successful February 12 audition for the show's producer, Peter Pilbeam, consisted of two Lennon-McCartney songs, "Hello Little Girl" and "Like Dreamers Do", along with "Till There Was You" and "Memphis". Of these, only the last song was played again for their first broadcast.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  1. "Hello Little Girl" is a well-known Lennon-McCartney composition, which was played during their Decca audition on January 1, 1962. It is really a pity that it has not been transmitted, as we do not have other performances of this song (other than a 1969 tape).
  <br/>
  2. "Memphis, Tennessee" was first released by Chuck Berry in July 1959 and had plenty of cover versions. The Beatles performed it during the Decca audience and five times at the BBC but never released it officially. All these versions closely match Chuck Berry's original recording. Lead vocalist: John
  <br/>
  3. "Dream Baby". The original version had been released by Roy Orbison only one month before and was doing very well in the American charts. Paul takes the lead in this Beatles cover (which however cannot compete with Orbison's original take!).
  <br/>
  4. "Please Mr. Postman". It was first recorded by the American group The Marvelettes in 1961. The version from this show is quite interesting for two reasons: it precedes its official release by one year, and it is the only live version (the other two BBC appearances were taped in the studio in 1963 and 1964). The Beatles' arrangement is already almost identical to the released one, however, it is more rock 'n' roll than the original record. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Purple Chick's previously unbooted tape (and the releases that copied it) sounds much better than other releases.

  <br/>
  3. P.S. I LOVE YOU
  <br/>
  4. SHEILA (not broadcast)
  <br/>
  The last available recording with Pete Best on drums.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  1. "Ask Me Why". This live version predates the Star Club one by six months and the officially released version by seven. It is the first available version, although very similar to later ones. Played 4 times at the BBC.
  <br/>
  2. "Besame Mucho". One of the Beatles' favourite "classic" songs. They performed it in their live act during 1961-62, they played it at their Decca audition and their initial Parlophone session (with Pete Best), and it was revived in 1969 and is shown in the film "Let It Be" , although this is the only BBC rendition. The Beatles' version is probably derived from the Coaster cover which had good success in 1960. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  3. "A Picture Of You". The only Beatles recording of this song, which was a hit by Joe Brown and the Bruvvers and had just entered the charts. George's first lead vocal at the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Purple Chick's previously unbooted tape (and the releases that copied it) sounds much better than other releases.

  <br/>
  3. P.S. I LOVE YOU
  <br/>
  4. SHEILA (not broadcast)
  <br/>
  Broadcast 26 October 1962 on "Here We Go". This recording has often been identified as coming from the TV show "People And Places", but I disagree due to the audience noise and electric guitars which clash with Lewisohn's description of that TV appearance (no audience, and acoustics).
  <br/>
  This show was taped before a live audience. It was Ringo's first BBC session and the only live appearance of "P.S. I Love You". "A Taste Of Honey" predates its official release by a few months. During this session the Beatles also played their unique BBC version of "Sheila", which unfortunately was not aired. A Beatles cover of this song is available on the Hamburg Star Club record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  The Artifacts tape is a little longer at the end, so it has been edited onto Yellow Dog's ever-so-slightly better quality version.

  4. KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY BABY BBC.06.04
  <br/>
  5. BEAUTIFUL DREAMER BBC.06.05
  <br/>
  The first of ten appearances on Saturday Club. This programme was set up in 1958, offering a mix of pop, jazz,country, and rock. Being the only chance to hear this kind of music on the BBC, it soon gained great popularity in Great Britain and was an essential promotional medium for any artist. The Beatles took this opportunity to present their brand-new single, "Please Please Me", together with their first one.
  <br/>
  Only fragments of 'Please Please Me' are currently available - but the whole song exists and hopefully will surface shortly.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. "Some Other Guy".
  <br/>
  This song was recorded by Ritchie Barrett in May 1962 and quickly became a favourite of many groups. A very famous Beatles live version was filmed at the Cavern Club on August 22, 1962. The group presented this song at the BBC three times. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. "Keep Your Hands Off My Baby".
  <br/>
  This Goffin-King song was released in 1962 by Little Eva, and this is the only Beatles version known to exist. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. "Beautiful Dreamer". An old song written in the second half of the nineteenth century by Stephen Foster, which had other versions by Bing Crosby and Al Jolson. It became very famous in the fifties, and the Beatles probably learned their rock 'n' roll arrangement during their time in Hamburg. It was recorded there by fellow Liverpudlians, the Searchers, who released their version later in 1963. It is the Beatles' only known recorded performance. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  We stuck with the original Purple Chick presentation of this show - using our previously unbooted upgrade along with BBC Trailer's "Love Me Do". Then we added a few previously unheard fragments of Please Please Me, taken from the full song which exists (alas, the rest of the show apparently does not survive in this quality)

  4. I SAW HER STANDING THERE (not broadcast)
  <br/>
  The Beatles' last appearance on Here We Go. This show features the only live performance of track 2.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  We used Yellow Dog's version, which is probably just a different eq of Great Dane's tape.
  <br/>
  Here We Go was normally broadcast on Fridays, but for some reason this show was broadcast on a Tuesday. This was the Beatles' fifth and final appearance on the show, but host Ray Peters incorrectly refers to it as their fourth. Brian Epstein later cancelled three appearances scheduled for June and July. The series was originally titled Teenagers Turn: Here We Go and was the show on which the Beatles made their radio debut in March 1962.
  <br/>
  The Beatles also recorded I Saw Her Standing There for this particular show, but it was edited from the final broadcast. This was the first time that the public got to hear Do You Want To Know A Secret and Misery as the Beatles' debut LP wouldn't be released until 22 March - on the same day that Kenny Lynch released Misery. His was the first cover version, while Billy J. Kramer &amp; the Dakotas' version of Do You Want To Know A Secret would be released in April.
  <br/>
  This show was recorded three days before the beginning of their U.K. tour, opening for Tommy Roe and Chris Montez. The single version of Please Please Me had just topped the New Musical Express chart, hence the reference in Ray Peters' introduction, although this wasn't the chart which the BBC normally used.
  <br/>
  Here We Go's house band was the Northern Dance Orchestra, aka the NDO, one of several bands employed by the BBC to fulfil a long-held agreement with the Musicians Union. Bands like the NDO, the Midlands Dance Orchestra, etc., were Musicians Union members and had to be employed to fulfil the BBC commitment to "live" music. It was because of this agreement that bands like the Beatles were booked to play live. A certain amount of "live" music time had to be alloted to counter the then-growing amount of time given over to the playing of records, so-called "needle time" in radio parlance. Hence, some shows like Here We Go, Pop Go The Beatles, and others were entirely live with no records played, while Saturday Club and Top Gear were a mixture of records and pre-recorded live sessions. Radio Luxembourg and the pirate stations (which appeared in 1964) had no such agreement with the Musicians Union and just played records.
  <br/>
  The Trad Lads may have been another Musicians Union member band, specially formed for the purposes of radio work on the BBC. However, a group called the Trad Grads recorded for Decca in 1963. Ben Richmond recorded two songs for Pye's Piccadilly label in 1963. Warmed Over Kisses was not one of them.
  <br/>
  About the survival of this particular tape
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This show survives only because one of the evening's performers taped it directly off of FM radio onto a domestic tape recorder (which explains the superb sound quality). The 13'46" worth of Here We Go featuring the Beatles' three songs was buried in the middle of nearly three hours' worth of recordings of children playing, a few other minor off-air recordings, and the like. The original tape - believed to be in the possession of the original taper - is complete as reproduced here, but it is shedding oxide and was poorly spooled. Additionally, it was recorded as four mono tracks to get the maximum recording time, so it is impossible to play back on most conventional domestic open-reel decks.
  <br/>
  The tape was salvaged by a recording expert in the UK, who transferred it onto analogue cassette while performing some minor tweaking. All that was done after this transfer was to feed the recording through No-Noise and Sonic Solutions to eliminate the prominent hiss, while a touch of boost was added to the drums. Unlike most Beatles' BBC sessions, this recording comes directly off an original open-reel copy, via a single generation of professionally recorded cassette without Dolby noise reduction. As such, you are hearing a fourth-generation-from-source recording (two analogic and two digital generations), which is closer to source than most commercial recordings. Any minor drop-outs are due to the age of the original open-reel tape; however, whenever possible these were edited.
  <br/>
  This recording came to light just after the release of Great Dane's 9CD box set, in the Spring of 1994, and was donated to Great Dane to help complete the saga of the Beatles at the BBC.
  <br/>
  Great Dane Records is proud to offer this exceptional tape to all Beatles fans and collectors, and also wishes to express sincere thanks to the owner of the original tape for having made this possible. Enjoy and ... stay tuned!!!

  6. THE HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE BBC.10.06
  <br/>
  This show was broadcast live, a rarity for Saturday Club, because one of the Beatles had a severe cold the day the recording was scheduled. Although it predates the release of their first LP by just one week , the group only played three cuts from it, the remaining songs being rock classics.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  3. "Too Much Monkey Business". A Chuck Berry number originally released in 1956. The Beatles presented it four times on the BBC, always in a powerful arrangement. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  4. "I'm Talking About You". The only BBC recording of another Berry song, originally released in 1961; also played by the Beatles in Hamburg. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  6. "The Hippy Hippy Shake". Originally released by Chan Romero in 1959, it soon became a Beatles favourite: it was taped in Hamburg and played 5 times during the BBC shows. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Here's a dilemma. Purple Chick's unbooted tape sounds significantly better, but there's significant interference here and there. Yellow Dog's tape sounds a little worse but has no interference. We tried editing them together, but that just wasn't working. So most of this show comes from Yellow Dog. We edited on the very beginning of "I Saw Her Standing There" from Purple Chick's tape as it was missing from Yellow Dog's. Also, we chose the Deflating The Mythology version of "I'm Talking About You" and added an unbooted tape to top and tail the ends.

  The title track was played by the Karl Denver Trio, with John and Paul adding their vocals to Karl Denver's. The backing track was used for all three of the Beatles' appearances, with a different voice-over by John Dunn. All the songs here included, with the exclusion of "Long Tall Sally", had already been released. These versions are played in arrangements nearly identical to the released ones.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  3. "Long Tall Sally". This version predates the official version, which was recorded in February 1964, by nearly one year. It is quite interesting as its arrangement is clearly distinct from the released one, particularly in the rockabilly guitar solos. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  5. "Chains". Released in late 1962 by the American group The Cookies, it was clearly one of the Beatles favourites. They not only included it on their first LP but also performed it four times at the BBC, starting with Here We Go, January 25, 1963. 'From Me To You' is currently unavailable.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Yellow Dog's tape is a little better, except for their glitch in "Long Tall Sally". We fixed that using Great Dane.

  <br/>
  Their third Saturday Club appearance features songs from their first LP, plus two tracks, "Long Tall Sally" and "Money (That's What I Want)", which appeared on a Beatles disc only in November 1963.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  6. "Money (That's What I Want)". The first hit for Motown, by Barrett Strong in 1960, and one of the classic numbers in the Beatles' repertoire. They played it often (including the Decca session), and it was released on their second LP in November 1963. There are 6 BBC takes, four of which predated the commercial release. These versions differ from the one taped at the EMI studio which included a piano intro. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  You may disagree, but Great Dane gets my vote for this show, just edging out Yellow Dog. It's a pretty subjective call though.

  Only the first two tracks seem to have been preserved, in comparatively inferior quality. This is the first BBC performance of Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven" and predates its official release on the Beatles' 2nd LP by about 5 months
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  It was never going to be much improvement, but for what it's worth, we used Yellow Dog.

  <br/>
  7. THE HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE
  <br/>
  8. POP GO THE BEATLES
  <br/>
  The first appearance on the most important series of radio shows for the Beatles' career. A trial of four programmes had been scheduled first, but it proved so popular that the series counted eleven more transmissions. It should be kept in mind that when Pop Go The Beatles started, the Beatles had scored only two number one records, and one year before they were virtually unknown outside of Liverpool: the BBC decision was an extremely progressive one. The Beatles enjoyed this programme and had fun joking with the announcers, reading fans' cards, and introducing their songs. What's more interesting is that the group, more than on other programmes, used to play a great number of rock and pop classics, which they never commercially released on record. The title track of the programme was a new arrangement of the nursery rhyme "Pop Goes The Weasel". Although from the first show only "The Hippy Hippy Shake" did not make it onto disc, two more songs were still unreleased in June 1963: "Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby" and "You Really Got A Hold On Me".
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  3. "Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby" was by Carl Perkins and was on his self-titled 1959 UK LP.The Beatles included it in their repertoire years before releasing it in November 1964, and indeed this BBC version closely matches the released one. They performed it 5 times at the BBC, twice before the official release, twice to promote their "Beatles For Sale" LP, and the last time during their last appearance in 1965. Lead vocalist: George.
  <br/>
  5. "You Really Got A Hold On Me". Another American classic, written by Smokey Robinson for the Miracles. It was performed four times on the BBC before its release on the Beatles' second album. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Not only does Yellow Dog sound better (except for the glitch in the PGTB theme, which we fixed with BBC Trailer) it also includes a new introduction.

  Considering that track 6 was still unreleased in June 1963, we have 4 "new" performances here, 3 of which never made it onto disc. Track 3 is complete and in the best possible quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  2. "A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues". The original version had been released in March 1962 by Arthur Alexander as the flip side of another R &amp; B standard, "You Better Move On". It soon became very famous, with many covers. They performed it twice more for the BBC. They apparently learned it in Hamburg since John wrote from there in April 1962 to his then-girlfriend Cynthia Powell to "send me the words of 'A Shot of Rhythm + Blues' please? There's not many." Lead vocal: John.
  <br/>
  5. "Sure To Fall (In Love With You)". Another Carl Perkins song, recorded in 1956. It was a favourite of the Beatles, who considered it for release in 1964. Although it eventually was not included on their discs, we know the Decca audition version and four more takes at the BBC. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Yellow Dog has the best sounding tape and includes new segments, although "From Me To You" is slightly longer on Great Dane, which also has a more complete version of the show outro. Naturally these were all merged into the best presentation possible for this show.

  <br/>
  3. "I Got To Find My Baby" was another Chuck Berry number, first played by Little Walter in 1954 and released by Berry in 1960. The Beatles played it twice at the BBC, this performance being distinctly better. Lead vocalist: John.
  <br/>
  4. "Young Blood". A song originally released by The Coasters in 1957. This is the only available Beatles version. Lead vocalist: George

  The origianal Pyramid release wins out on this one although a few seconds of applause at the end of "A Taste Of Honey" were grafted on from Yellow Dog. Otherwise, YD's release is a little distorted.

  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  5. "I'll Be On My Way". This is the most fascinating item of the programme, and for sure one of the highlights of the Beatles' entire BBC career. It is a Lennon-McCartney song which the Beatles gave to Billy J. Kramer and never recorded for EMI. Billy J.'s recording at EMI took place the same day as the Beatles' BBC session (April 4, 1963), so it seems likely that the group tried out the song at the BBC before giving it to the performer. When more than two months later the programme was broadcast, Billy J. Kramer had already scored number one in the charts! 'Love Me Do' apparently has not been preserved.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Becase of Yellow Dog's glitch, the theme song is taken from a combination of Silent Sea and BBC Trailer (Trailer silenced out the gap in the tape, but sounded better, SS kept the tape hiss - we merged them). Otherwise Yellow Dog is the best source.

  somewhat less interesting programme, where the Beatles only played already released material. This was to be the last programme of the series, but with the tremendous success it had, 11 more programmes were scheduled for the following months.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  The majority of this show was taken from Yellow Dog, which sounds better. However YD simply copies the Masterfraction versions of track 6 while Great Dane's tape is longer at the end of each.

  <br/>
  11. ASK ME WHY (not broadcast)
  <br/>
  The best of the BBC Beatles performances! Of the nine songs recorded for this show, seven were never to appear on a Beatles disc; five of these have been transmitted (luckily those which were not taped on other BBC sessions), while "Sweet Little Sixteen" was re-recorded for the next programme of the series. "Three Cool Cats" had an unfortunate fate at the BBC: it was taped twice (the first time during the recording session for Here We Go, January 25, 1963) but never broadcast; we only know it from the Decca session.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  2. "That's All Right" was Elvis Presley's first single, released back in 1954. As with the other classics broadcast in this programme, this is the only BBC version ever taped by the Beatles. Lead vocalist, much in Presley's style, is Paul.
  <br/>
  4. "Carol". A rock'n'roll song written by Chuck Berry and released in 1958. As is often the case with Berry's repertoire, the group adheres closely to the original while John sings a very spirited vocal.
  <br/>
  5. "Soldier Of Love". An intriguing song by Arthur Alexander, released in 1962, and a powerful interpretation by John. Also excellent is Ringo's drumming.
  <br/>
  6. "Lend Me Your Comb". A Carl Perkins tune released in the U.K. in 1958 and also included on the Hamburg December 31, 1962 tape. Lead vocal is shared by John &amp; Paul.
  <br/>
  7. "Clarabella". This song was released by the Jodimars in 1956, but failed to have any particular success on either side of the ocean. It is thus somewhat surprising that the Beatles played their own version of this number which was probably completely unknown to their audience. Nevertheless, it's a great performance by Paul.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Yellow Dog is horribly distorted throughout so we stuck with Great Dane for the most part - which sounds great.

  <br/>
  Again a great show: three songs were only taped on this occasion during the Beatles' BBC career, and also the re-recording of "Sweet Little Sixteen". rack three was thought to have been lost, but eventually surfaced on 'The Beatles Live At The BBC' CD.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  2. "Sweet Little Sixteen". One of the most famous (and covered) Berry songs, originally released in 1958. It was a mainstay in the Beatles repertoire and was also recorded at the Star Club, Hamburg. Lead vocalist is John, who gives a great performance.
  <br/>
  4. "Nothin' Shakin'". A rockabilly number sung by George, who obviously liked this style. It was originally recorded by Eddie Fontaine in 1958.
  <br/>
  6. "Lonesome Tears In My Eyes" is a Johnny Burnette Trio number released in November 1956. Lead vocalist is John.
  <br/>
  7. "So How Come (No One Loves Me)". This Everly Brothers song enjoyed success in the USA in late 1960. Lead vocalist: George
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Yellow Dog generally sounds better and has a new segment.

  NOTES
  <br/>
  This programme was recorded the same day as PGBT (6). At the time of this broadcast tracks 5 and 6 were unreleased, while tracks 2 and 7 never made it onto record.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  5. "Matchbox". Although credited to Carl Perkins, this is in fact an old blues song recorded by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1927. Perkins' version, from which the Beatles derived their cover, was released in 1957. This take predates the officially released version by nearly one year and is slightly different in lyrics and arrangement. Lead vocalist: Ringo
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  For the most part, Yellow Dog sounds better - it also has a new segment - except for the tracks included on the Masterfraction release. Even for those YD has slightly longer fades, so we edited them back in. The old vinyl release Broadcasts has a version of "Til There Was You" without the wow and flutter caused by tape drag that is evident on other releases, so we used that here, editing on the clipped beginning and end from Yellow Dog.

  8. POP GO THE BEATLES
  <br/>
  Together with Pop Go The Beatles (5), this is the most important BBC programme ever taped by the Beatles. In August 1963, only track 7 was known to the audience, and track 4 would be released on disc only more than one year later. All the other songs were played at the BBC only on this occasion.
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  2. "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry (Over You)" was first recorded by Roy Hamilton in 1954 and also released by Elvis Presley in 1956. The Beatles covered this second version. Lead vocalist: Paul.
  <br/>
  3. "Crying Waiting Hoping". Another highlight from the unreleased BBC takes. This song was recorded by Buddy Holly just a few weeks before his tragical death in the plane crash of February 2, 1959. A backing track was added to his home-recorded voice and guitar, and the disc was released in June 1959. The Beatles were great fans of Buddy Holly and recorded this song both at the Decca audition and for this programme, this version being by far better. Lead vocalist: George.
  <br/>
  4. "Kansas City/ Hey!-Hey!-Hey!-Hey!". Little Richard recorded his own composition "Hey!-Hey!-Hey!-Hey! (Goin' Back To Birmingham) in 1958. In 1959 he rerecorded it in a medley with "Kansas City", which was a number one single in the USA for Wilbert Harrison in May 1959. The Beatles included this medley in their repertoire from the beginning. Paul, who was particularly fond of Little Richard's songs, takes the lead vocal.
  <br/>
  5. "To Know Her Is To Love Her". This is the Beatles' cover version (with "him" changed to "her") of the Teddy Bears' number from 1958, with a noticeably different arrangement (the Teddy Bears were Phil Spector, who would produce the "Let It Be" album at the end of the Beatles' career, with Annette Kleinbard and Marshall Leib). It was also played by the Fab Four in Hamburg. Lead vocalist: John
  <br/>
  6. "The Honeymoon Song". The title song from the 1959 film "Honeymoon" was first performed by Manuel and the Music of the Mountains. In June 1959 Marino Marini and his Quartet released a vocal version. Although not typical of the Beatles' style, Paul seems to have liked this song a lot since he not only sang it at the BBC but also produced a version for Mary Hopkin in 1969.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  For the most part Yellow Dog sounds better and has a longer outro to "To Know Her Is To Love Her". The exception are the songs which appear on Masterfraction, which sound better, but have the longer endings from Yellow Dog restored.

  8. POP GO THE BEATLES
  <br/>
  This programme was taped the same day as PGTB (8) and PGTB (10), a real marathon in the BBC studio. Only three items were unreleased when broadcast (2, 5 and 7), and only track 7 has not been released by the Beatles; however, "She Loves You" and "I'll Get You" make their debut here (they would be released as a single on August 23). John and Paul make a little mistake with the lyrics of "She Loves You".
  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  7. "I Got A Woman". A hit by Ray Charles in 1954, covered by Elvis Presley in 1956. The group played Elvis' version twice at the BBC. Both these takes are powerful, although quite different from each other. Another unforgettable performance.
  <br/>
  THE SOUND
  <br/>
  Yellow Dog generally sounds better. However "I Got A Woman" is superior on Masterfraction, but again the longer Yellow Dog ending is Yellow Dog restored.

  <br/>
  THE SONGS
  <br/>
  3. "Words Of Love". Another Buddy Holly number, originally released in 1957. This and the next song have great rockabilly guitar by George. John and Paul share the vocal leads.
  <br/>
  4. "Glad All Over". A Carl Perkins song released in December 1957 in the USA. As with most of Perkins' numbers in the Beatles repertoire, it was sung by George.
  <br/>
  5. "I Just Don't Understand". Another song not typical of the Beatles' style, originally performed by
