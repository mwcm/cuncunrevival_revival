  Isis made three albums in a career that stretched to six or seven years, produced, respectively, by Shadow Morton, Alain Toussaint and Len Barry! That covers quite a lot of ground, and so did the band, whose sound managed to cram in spiky R&amp;B, soul-jazz, blues, smooth soul, straight-out pop and Santana-esque rock, with an air that ranged from sweetly hippie to proudly feminist (as you might expect from an all-woman band in the early 1970s, when such things were in the air). This, their second album, is the Toussaint-produced one, and he's quite the presence: he also wrote about half the record, leaving the others to the band (in particular singer Carol Macdonald, who also acts as producer on her tracks). I prefer the debut, which is more exciting and eccentric (and has a different band line-up), but this one is probably more consistent and immediate. The title track and "Icy Winds" would make a fine addition to your mid-'70s mixtape, although the album's highlight is Macdonald's "Bobbie and Maria", a touching tale of same-sex longing. Macdonald's singing don't hurt a bit either.
