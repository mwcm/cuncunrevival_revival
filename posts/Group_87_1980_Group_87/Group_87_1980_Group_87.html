  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   GROUP 87 were formed as a trio of highly-successful session and solo artists in the early eighties. While they existed for only a few years, they left behind two highly-acclaimed instrumental albums that are considered landmarks by many new-age, jazz, and progressive rock artists even today. The band consisted of multi-instrumentalists Mark Isham and Peter Maunu, as well as bassist Patrick O'Hearn.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Isham began his musical career early as a sort of child prodigy in a number of San Francisco area bands including the psychedelically-influenced SONS OF CHAMPLIN, founded by future CHICAGO keyboardist/guitarist Bill Champlain, before moving on to the jazz quartet RUBIZA PATROL. He also performed and recorded with blues legend TAJ MAHAL, as well as with VAN MORRISON and BOZ SKAGGS, among others.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Maunu performed as a classical violinist and gained the rating of concert master while still in his teens, earning him a scholarship to study at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He recorded with JEAN-LUC PONTY, BILLY COBHAM, and AIRTO among others, and was a founding member of the L.A. EXPRESS.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   O'Hearn began his career as a touring member of FRANK ZAPPA's band while barely out of his teens, before basically being fired when he turned his energy and attention to the GROUP 87 project at the close of the seventies. The three met and became friends while in their teens in California, performing and recording demo tracks together in between their various other projects. Former BLOOD, SWEAT &amp; TEARS drummer Bobby Columby played a part in their signing by Columbia Records in 1979, which led to their debut release. While former Zappa drummer and future founder of MISSING PERSONS Terry Bozzio declined an invitation to join the band, he did contribute drum tracks for their first album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band drifted apart soon after their debut release, a victim of a depressed music market, fast-changing public tastes, and too much success by the individual members in their respective solo and project efforts. Columby left Columbia about the same time, but resurfaced three years later with EMI/Capitol and signed Isham to reform the group for their final release, 'A Career in Dada Processing' in 1984.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band's sound was a highly-polished blend of jazzy rock and techno with sometimes intense guitar and drum arrangements, while overall having the feel of early new-age music. Their compositions were all carefully arranged instrumentals with layers of keyboards and synthesizers and accented by Isham's trumpet (and mandolin with the second album). There is virtually no improvisation in their music, suggesting them to be somewhat closer to a progressive electronic sound than to more traditional jazz/fusion. Guest drummers appeared on both albums (Terry Bozzio on the first, and MIKE AND THE MECHANICS drummer Peter Van-Hooke, long-time L.A. area session musician Michael Barsimanto, and former WIRE TRAIN drummer Brian MacLeod on the second). Peter Wolf also appeared on the first release.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All the members of GROUP 87 have enjoyed great critical and commercial success in their careers following the band's demise. Isham has released a number of new-age jazz recordings, including the famed 'Vapor Drawings' in 1983 and a Grammy award-winning self-titled album in 1990. He has also produced dozens of film and television soundtracks and theme songs. Maunu released a well-received new-age solo album entitled 'Warm Sound in a Gray Field' in 1990 after several years as a featured performance in the Arsenio Hall Show band, and has appeared in or produced a number of movie soundtracks of his own. And following a stint in Bozzio's new-wave eighties MTV-darling band MISSING PERSONS, O'Hearn embarked on a lengthy and still-going career as a new-age solo artist.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is an entirely instrumental album, consisting solely of drums, trumpet, bass, and guitar, with the remainder of sounds coming out of a variety of keyboards and synthesizers operated by Isham. This is a sound that is undeniably eighties, but is also rather difficult to classify. While one might be tempted to lump then with more traditional jazz/fusion bands, there is nothing improvisational about this music. Every note seems carefully orchestrated and executed with precision. Each arrangement starts around a central basic rhythm, and then constructs a series of progressions that often seem to have little to do with that rhythm, usually with a combination of percussion and synthesized keyboards. The whole thing works deliciously well.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Future of the City” starts with a cold and glistening electric piano that is joined by a quiet, jazzy trumpet before blossoming into a rich blend of guitar, drums and cymbals. The whole thing sounds like a Joe Jackson (ala ‘Night and Day’) piano-bar tune with a little cool Al DiMeolo thrown in for effect, while Maunu’s guitar work is just pure fusion. Midway through the tempo shifts with a warm synthesized passage with Isham’s trumpet rising above in an almost celestial fashion. A great opening to an unusual album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The basic rhythm of “Magnificent Clockworks” reminds me a lot of Jeff Beck’s version of “Goodbye Pork-Pie Hat” with its purposeful and driving beat that is at the same time smooth and soothing. Guest drummer Terry Bozzio is spectacular, particularly as he works above the rim with some great percussion. Maunu’s guitar work is funky but very measured and Isham lays some melodic and spacey keyboards on the whole thing to give it a bit of a fast-paced ballroom feel. If you’ve ever heard Georgio Morodor’s work on the ‘Electric Dreams’ soundtrack, you’ll have an idea of the tenor of this track.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The group slows down considerably for “Frontiers: 1856”, a lazy keyboard-driven piece with some very lush bass and acoustic guitar passages that just seem to float around the room on a good stereo. The acoustic qualities of this track are just superb. My only complaint about this particular recording is that it is entirely too brief. This could have easily been developed with some nuances of time and movement built into the arrangement to even greater effect.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Maunu gets a bit funky with his electric guitar on “Sublime Feline”, with Isham seeming to work at keeping up with Bozzio’s aggressive tempo. Isham also weaves some really unusual trumpet work in, very dissonant tones that blend very well with keyboards. Behind all of this is a persistent bell-like synthesizer rhythm that gives this a futuristic feel, or as close to one that a twenty-seven year old recording can muster. The disassociated ending is very unique, and much more interesting than the fadeout ending used on most of the tracks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The back side of the vinyl album opens with “The Bedouin”, a pulsating, snared beat from Bozzio along with a stark piano score that sounds very much like the album’s opening track. This almost sounds as if the band took the opening number and just slowed it down a bit, but the slightly syncopated beat dresses it up with a completely new sound. Other than the drums, this is an almost completely synthesized composition, and would not have been out-of-place on one of the later Alan Parsons Project albums.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “While the City Sleeps” is also heavy on early techno sounds, but like “Frontiers” the tempo is slow and smooth. Isham’s trumpet here is as close to pure jazz as he gets anywhere on the album, but once again the whole thing seems to be more like a sampler, and should have been developed quite a bit more.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Moving Sidewalks” is centered around a choppy electric piano riff and string-driven synthesizer, along with more of the interwoven and understated trumpet work that almost sounds synthetic itself (heck, maybe it is). Useless trivia – Moving Sidewalks was the name of ZZ Top Billy Gibbon’s first band. Has nothing to do with this song, but thought I’d bring it up.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Hall of Glass” sounds like something that Luc-Ponty might have done, quietly executed with careful attention paid to each note, but no particular theme to drive it and so left to the interpretation of the listener. While the album as a whole is quite strong, this one borders ever so slightly on filler.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album closes on “One Night Away From Day”, dominated almost completely by Maunu’s soaring guitar passages and Bozzio’s avant drum work. This is another track that could easily pass for something from Jeff Beck around the same timeframe, and works very well to cap off the album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Like I said before, this is a rather unusual album that is difficult to classify. While on first listen it seems a bit light and fluffy, repeated playing reveals the high level of precision and virtuoso playing of each musician. The band suffered from poor management as well as a major slump in the record industry in the early eighties, so there was little promotion of the album, and the members moved on to other ventures. They would reform for another album a few years later, but it lacked the fresh feel and quiet energy of this debut. This is a great recording for those who enjoy skillful musicianship and tight fusion with an early techno feel to it. A worthwhile investment if you can find it.
