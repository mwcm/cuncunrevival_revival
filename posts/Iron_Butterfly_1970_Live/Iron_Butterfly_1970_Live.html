  bought this album in 1983. The main curiosity was to listen to the live version of "In-a- gadda-da-vida", but the album is good as a whole.
  <br/>
  The album starts with three songs form their "Ball" album. "In the Time of Our Lives" has a heavy introduction with distorted guitar. This guitar is so distorted in some parts of the song that it sounds like Brann lost control of it! This is a Ingle-Bushy composition, which ends with a snare drum, played like in a military band. "Filled with Fear" is another "sinister" song, reflected more in Ingle`s vocals. He also wrote this song alone. "Soul Experience", a song composed by Ingle-Bushy-Brann-Dorman, is another Hippy-Flower Power song which has some interesting arrangements, one of them a note-by-note melody played together by the organ and the guitar, like extracted from an early "electronic music played on the moog" album, albums which were very popular in the late 60s / early 70s. I remember that this particular section of this song (but taken from the studio version) was used in a T.V. commercial for car mechanical tools in my country in the early 70s!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next song is from their first album called "Heavy", but composed by founder members Danny Weis and Darryl DeLoach, called "You Can`t Win". It is a very "Pop Rock" song in style. I don`t know why they chose to include this song in this live album as it wasn`t written by Ingle or Bushy, the remaining founder members of the band.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next song is from the "In-a-gadda-da-vida"album, a fast version of "Are You Happy?" (composed by Ingle), played with a lot of distortion from Brann`s guitar. I prefer the studio version of this song. The last song of this album is "In-a-gadda-da- vida" (also composed by Ingle), played with some differences: a) the drums solo is longer that the studio version, but played without using the "sound effects" applied to the drums, so it sounds more "simple" than in the studio version; b) the guitar solos are different in structure, but Dorman plays the bass very well; c) one part of the song is not played (the part which includes a bass riff near the end of the song) or was edited out of the album; d) the song is longer in comparison to the studio version due to the drums solo, but played maybe with "an urgency" to finish it, like they were tired of playing it many times on tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One funny thing that I listened in this album was the interaction between the band and the audience. It is maybe more of "historic importance" now: a woman in the audience sings a not identified "song" during the drums solo! It was the time of the Hippies (the cover design is also very "Hippy" / "Flower Power" and psychedelic in style). This interaction is similar to parts of The Doors`"Absolutely Live" album. "Those Were the Days", as Mary Hopkin sang in 1968! "Peace and Love"!
