   I wouldn't call myself an expert on jazz. Among the other stuff in my collection I have a few records and CDs that might properly be called "jazz." I don't select music by saying to myself, I like this genre and not that one. I subscribe to the Duke Ellington theory, "If it sounds good, it is good!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Which brings us to the great saxophonist Ornette Coleman. Back in the early 1980s with the advent of "new music," I used to listen to a radio show on a local community station where the host played punk/new wave and reggae while sprinkling in the occasional Ornette Coleman track maybe once or twice a month. I liked those tunes but in my youth wondered how and why it all fit. Today I get it. As I see it, Ornette Coleman is the founder of the "no wave" genre. Not that I'm aware of any "no wave" bands ever having acknowledged him as such - actually I'm pretty sure that none ever did. Regardless, it seems to me that Coleman was the first musician to break all the rules - or at least the first to break them so severely, the musical equivalent of driving 120 mph in the opposite lane. He was "no wave" way back in 1959 with The Shape of Jazz to Come.

   Music can be like a language, whether we're conscious of that or not. Ever catch yourself suddenly humming along to a song you're hearing for the first time? It's because you have an idea where the song is going. With Coleman, you never know where he's going. The next note you hear isn't the note you expected to hear. The drummer pounds away without accenting a beat, while the bass, traditionally a time-keeping instrument in jazz, is playing a melody of his own, making it hard to identify where one bar ends and the next begins. His music usually had no guitar or piano playing chords. If you have a certain comfort zone with music, Coleman will take you out of it and challenge you.

   Then came 1976 and this first album with Coleman's first electric band, Prime Time, featuring two guitarists, bass, and drums, and on the last two tracks, clarinet and the Master Musicians of Jojouka. It didn't cause the same stir as Bob Dylan going electric. No matter; this is a stunning piece of work. The old boss of 1959 had become the new boss of 1976. Nobody called it "no wave" or even used that term in 1976, but the album made so much sense in light of what was to come with the punk revolution. As always, there are no chords or discernible beat. Every instrument has its own melody to play, all going in different, crazy directions. It almost has the feel of a group of novices picking up instruments for the first time and seeing what kind of sounds they can make - but it all fits together into a chaotic cacophony of sound that's compelling, fun to listen to, often surprisingly catchy, and (at least on the first two cuts) hard to resist jumping up and down to. If it's repetitive at times, it's still never boring. Whether it's "jazz" or not - who cares? Just turn up the speakers and prepare to be blown away.

   When the term "70's jazz fusion" is used, most folks probably think of Miles Davis' brand of downer space funk or all that goopy Return to Mahavishnu's Inner Mounting Weather Report stuff. But of course when Ornette Coleman did "jazz fusion in the 70's" it didn't sound like what his peers were doing at the time anymore than his "modern jazz of the 50's" sounded like what Miles, Mingus, Coltrane et. al were doing back then either. The bulk of this little gem from the Ornette discography consists of the best ever example of "Ornette Fusion", along with a final track documenting an excursion to Africa for a musical communion, producing predictably trippy results.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Why is this not your pony-tailed uncle's "fusion"? First of all the drumming on "Theme" is berserk -- and since Ornette had been using his son Denardo on drums since he was about 10 years old (and who played drums exactly like you'd think a 10 year old would), the standards for what counts as berzerker drumming on an Ornette record are very high as you might imagine! Basically Jackson sounds like two takes of Denardo's drumming overdubbed on top of each other, banging and clattering and rimshotting away like no tomorrow.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It's tempting to compare Nix &amp; Ellerbee's guitars to Zoot Horn Rollo and Antennare Jimmy Semens and all them other great Magic Band guitar duos, but really they sound more like Jimmy Nolan (James Brown's guy) and his evil twin surgically sewn together by the tops of their heads, still punchy from the anesthesia so given a healthy dose of amphetamine to pep them up into a cartoonish frenzy.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But seriously, Ornette may well have been influenced by a Trout Mask Replica sensibility here (I believe it, and think I read somewhere that DVV hisself said so too -- tho I'm just as sure Ornette would say he's never heard of the Captain.) And at the same time I think it's pretty obvious that Ornette was one of the key influences on the Beefheart approach to music in the first place -- compare "Hair Pie" from 1969 to something like "Moon Inhabitants" from 1960, I dare ya!*

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Anyway the tune they're jamming on in two "Variations" here is indeed a theme from a symphony (the section entitled "The Good Life" from "Skies of America" 1972 by Ornette Coleman, an LP recorded with the LSO and quite a great "jazz-classical fusion" by the way.) It's a sort of Carribean mardi-gras childlike sing-a-long melody that Ornette blows like a Sufi trance master, the same little tune fragment over and over dozens of times with subtle rhythm shifts and no pauses for breath (he's mastered circular breathing.) "Variation One" is longer and features Ornette mostly, pretty much driving repetition ruling the take. "Variation Two" I like a little better cuz the O-man's blowing is free-er, and cuz the guitar players get to cut loose on some wacky jazz-rock-skronk solos every now &amp; then (Vernon Reid must love this stuff.)

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And really -- when was the last time you listened to "jazz fusion" that sounded so absolutely brimming with JOY but at the same time was totally non-sentimental? Usually this is a genre that is either depressing (Miles) or cloying (everyone else up to &amp; including the Kenny G's of the world.) That makes this record almost one of a kind.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Ornette would go on to make more "fusion" records with his band Prime Time on through to the 90's, but I don't think any of them really approach the unique blend of chaotic joy found in the relatively simple groovin' here (though the follow-up to this album, "Body Meta" comes the closest.)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The closing track "Midnight Sunrise" sounds like it comes from another sonic universe entirely -- it is spooky, mystical, otherworldly, and a bag of chips. Makes me think of Burroughsian "Naked Lunch" visions of nude arab boys in desert dances with giant centipedes and such (associating Ornette's collaboration with Howard Shore on the soundtrack to the movie version with the North African spirit vision vibe I suppose -- anyway, it fits.)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A branch of the musical tree that may even yet grow fruit (this sounds like an ahead-of-its-time album meant to inspire it's own genre if ever there was one), this neat little LP comes from one of Ornette's more overlooked periods from the end of the 60's through to the mid 70's (what I think of as his "restless" period -- a bit like Neil Young in the 80's perhaps.) But it's pretty easy to find on CD reissues these days, so ch-ch-check it out.
