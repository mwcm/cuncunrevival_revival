  The Gurvitz boys may not have been able to count, but by 1974 they had perfected the fine art of creating a masterpiece.
  <br/>
  Their 3rd album, named 'Two' probably because of the first album being just the brothers and a selection of great drummers, this is their second album with Tony Newman (who would play for David Bowie and many others) and also their second for Warner Bros.
  <br/>
  This, for me, is one of the ultimate early 70's hard-rock albums, the songs are all thoughtfully-crafted and the musicians and vocals are top-notch.
  <br/>
  Favourites are the beautiful epics, 'Today' and 'I Can't Make The Blind See', rock instrumental 'Irving', and riffers 'Polecat Woman' and 'Burning Angel'.
  <br/>
  A wonderful rock album.

  Three Man Army's third and final album was, most confusingly, titled Three Man Army Two. The unintentionally clumsy name was in a way appropriate, however, for it was more of the same, whether it was the second or third Three Man Army you happened to come across, indeed falling somewhere between the second and third divisions of early-'70s British hard rock. Bland if energetic hard rock remained the main staple, "Polecat Woman" being one of the more blatant Led Zeppelin sound-alike tracks of the era. There were some mild detours in the orchestrated "I Can't Make the Blind See" (from an unreleased rock opera titled Three Days to Go), which sounds like a prototypical power ballad; the machine gun-riffing instrumental "Irving"; and "Today," which oh-so-vaguely echoed some of the ballads of the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac in places. No one's going to confuse the slide-guitar-and-orchestration-heralded ode to the outer space woman of "Space Is the Place" with Sun Ra, however.
