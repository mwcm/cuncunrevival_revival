   This is Blakey hot, live and cooking... and with Lee Morgan and Hank Mobley right up front...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I think its particularly interesting because in my opinion, of all the great frontmen Blakey assembled, this was my favorite line-up... in many ways were of the same school (hard bop), yet on the other hand were very different... Morgan, for example had a bit of Dizzy Gillespie old school bop in him... Mobley bopped and swung, but also took advantage in a different way... as a horn section they're really tight and powerful, and blacked by Blakey's unique "time keeping" + backbeat style drumming adapted to the context of modern Jazz, they're cooking. Jymie Merritt's bass playing is up on - - Bobby Timmons is... well, Bobby Timmons - - bluesy, Monkish at times, but a very fluent cooker and born with a left hand comp that really gave the Blakey sound the Blakey sound (what more can I say...?) -- last but definitely not least, Blakey's having a good time, though I don't quite get the high hat thing on "Justice" - -but heck...all the other tunes make up for it... and also its a live recording... bands take time to warm up... CLOSE YOUR EYES is the point in the performance where the band is really full gear and the band is tightest and most together... in the groove yet stretched out... of course, emcee PeeWee Marquette is also an important part of the show and demonstrates that there was once a time when Jazz was music to move to and get people excited, not BGM for checking your blackberry and texting. - - The first set climaxes with Just Coolin', which is one of the best Blakey vehicles of the set (the interplay in the beginning, and his trade mark high hat wap and chick-a-chee swing with the explosive press roll on the turn around and those distinct accents he used to do to push the soloist without losing the groove that NO ONE could like him...

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Vol. 2 is even hotter and brighter, starting with the bouncy St. Thomas-ish rhythm change Chicken' and Dumplins...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   and climaxing with the intense minor key Art's Revelation, a vehicle for a "Caravan" like solo for him to show off his solos and rhythms (unlike Buddy Rich, Blakey albums were about the overall ensemble that Blakey shaped in his image, not Blakey's solos, but Blakey solos were always delightful nonetheless and proved why they called him The Volcano!)

   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All in all, imagine if you could go back in time to the '50s and catch Blakey in his prime at a hot smokey Jazz club in NYC... imagine... imagine... now listen... (note - - since then they've banned smoking... what next? Whiskey... and Fried Chicken? Come on... Jazz was better when the musicians lived dangerously... and this music represents that long lost hip edge !

   The opening intro by Pee Wee is inauspicious in that there seems to be few in the audience and you are expecting far less than this album delivers.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The first track, Hank Mobley's "Hipsippy Blues", is an easy, swinging piece that is beautifully played (foot tapping even), but reinforces the initial impression from the intro. That notion is quickly dispelled when Blakey lays into his drums on Monk's "Evidence", named "Justice" on the album. "The Theme" assures you that you are listening to the Jazz Messengers as if you had any doubts. The final two tracks on disc 1 are beautifully and energetically performed.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On disc 2, "Chicken An' Dumplins" is a moderate tempo piece by Ray Bryant and moved along by Art's Latin-flavored, rhythmic playing. When Mobley comes in on his tenor the tune takes on a life of it's own. M &amp; M (stands for Mobley and Morgan), showcases both Hank's tenor and Lee's trumpet; however, the tenor is what grabs me because it seems to just soar. What I like about "Hi Fly" is Melba Liston arranged it. She was one of the great trombonists who is sadly forgotten these days. She was one of Dizzy Gillespie's favorite musicians and one of his peers when it came to composing and arranging - a stellar accolade considering how accomplished a composer and arranger Diz was. Lee Morgan's trumpet and Hank Mobley's tenor on this track are, once again, standouts. A firey, 9:13 rendition of "The Theme" keeps the momentum going. Lee Morgan's trumpet tone is simply exquisite on this track. At around 3:30 Mobley's tenor once again soars about the music (the best way I can describe it), and Blakey switches from his beat on two and four to some excellent comping behind Mobley. When Timmons's piano comes in around 5:25 Art goes back to two and four, and the entire piece melts me with its beauty. The finale, "Art's Revelation", starts with Timmons' intro with Blakey thundering behind him, and Morgan coming in. For a moment I thought I was listening to Clifford Brown! Bobby Timmons shines in a number of places on this track, and beautifully sets Blakey up for a solo around 5:40.

   I've focused perhaps too much on Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan and Art Blakey. Bobby Timmons and Jymie Merritt were also key ingredients to this wonderful album. I am a fan of both and do not want to give the impression that their playing was unimportant because that is not the case. I sometimes tend to focus on horns (or piano) to the exclusion of other instruments and musicians when writing reviews. Suffice to say that Merritt was one of the greats as proclaimed by Art on this album.
