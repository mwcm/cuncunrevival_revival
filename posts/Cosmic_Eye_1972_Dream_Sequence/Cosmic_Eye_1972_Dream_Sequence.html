   Recorded in 1972 at the legendary Landsdowne Studios in London, Cosmic Eye is an extraordinary piece of recorded music. Led by Indian born guitarist Amancio D’Silva, Cosmic Eye was a highly innovative studio experiment in which ‘Jazz Meets World’. Following in the footsteps of other pioneering Landsdowne jazz recordings such as Joe Harriott &amp; John Mayer’s Indo Jazz sessions, Cosmic Eye is modal, but is also under-pinned with traditional Indian instrumentation and structure, resulting in a hypnotic, psychedelic jazz excursion. Constructed into two conceptual pieces (Dream Sequences), two side-long jazz ragas showcasing D’Silva’s soulful guitar playing reminiscent of his earlier 60s sessions, Hum Dono and Integrations, as well as his session work for the Bollywood film industry under the musical directors Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Featuring a host of UK and Indian musicians, Cosmic Eye is a Singular recording from a fervently rich period of British modern jazz.

   The fashion and the music that were derived from the latter half of the 1960s. Those elements and fusion were very remarkable in the U.K. in particular. rock which let you introduce folk if psychedelic is carried out by various bands. The music absorbs culture and the music of various countries and uses many it. rock in particular and the fusion of the Indian music become very remarkable at this time. There was really it to a lot of musicians who devoted itself to culture and a musical instrument. It is certain that it was practiced music established not the fashion that they are simple as process to create. If is psychedelic; fusion of folk and rock. Or the introduction of the Indian music was the part which a musician expressed all in one body. The known musician and band existed in the flow that practiced them to some extent as raga rock, but there will be the situation that a fan of the minority recognizes even now. Therefore existence of such a band and group may be always divinized. The name of Third Ear Band and Quintessence is known as a field of known raga rock to a fan of raga rock to some extent. However, each band would give creation of the original music as a nucleus by introduction of folk if the situation as those days of the latter half of the 60s was psychedelic. There was the part that, as a result, a part of rock was strongly reflected in such a band, but there is often the band letting I let you are stronger and reflect those elements and succeed as original music when what I find becomes more difficult. However, the creation of the music that this Cosmic Eye performed in the existence of the band which showed admiration of the Indian music not the fashion conspicuously must be the thing that is one of raga rock and the music that you should call definitely particularly. It is said that this band has the form such as the project as information. However, the creation of the music that the musicians who participated were united can feel that all practices some purpose and directional agreement. The band which carries out admiration and a purpose well in the band where a musician from India does not participate in will surely exist. However, directionality and the creation act well even if the musician who participated in this Cosmic Eye was a project. The form of the project that I listed as the said article can look at the form by the musician who participated. At first what I appointed Denis Preston which let you introduce Indian music into the situation of the music of this time as as a producer. And other musicians having been familiar with such a music in each activity to some extent. And the fact that let a musician from India really participate. And the member of the group of John Mayer and him who are active as a violinist. And existence of Viram Jasani known as a well-known fact well. His existence will be known by having participated in a performance of "Black Mountain Side" of Led Zeppelin as tabla player. However, Viram Jasani plays sitar in Cosmic Eye. And there is the information to say that Ana Da Silva of the guitar player from India played a role as the traction in this project. Or Keshav Sathe of the tabla player is to join the group of John Renbourn after having participated in this project, and the name is known. This album is still known as a valuable, expensive album in the own country. In vinyl in particular. It was precious existence announced alone in 1972 by Regal Zonophone, but the information will be gradually known now in those days. I can feel complete raga rock as general musicality. Furthermore, the performance may often present an aspect of jazz rock because a musician playing a vibraphone and a wind instrument exists. Musicality including Sitar and tabla. The division of mental part and ensemble. And lenience and severity of ensemble and raga rock such as jazz rock developed in sequence. A method of the effective disposal of violin and guitars in relation to those elements. Not only the fan of Raga rock but also fan of jazz rock and the psychedelic fan will be albums having the development that I can enjoy enough. "Dream Sequence" is established from 14 parts; is constituted, but those titles of a musical composition do not really become clear. The constitution to advance to without being divided from a beginning to the end while various melodies and constitution show a different aspect is wonderful. A part of opening raga rock by Sitar and tabla. And the melody that I introduced beat rock and fusion into. The flow has the free form by a vibraphone and the performance of the flute. Raga Rock often tempts a listener into the mental world. The atmosphere slightly felt an atmosphere like Alusa Fallax. The part which let you introduce a form of Raga Rock and jazz well. They may have the part reminding of some free jazz. However, the development I let jazz rock fuse well while having the respect for traditional Indian music, and to advance to will be wonderful. This album let you take in the situation of the then music well partially and would carry it out. I function as raga rock where a factor of the compromise is felt generally.
