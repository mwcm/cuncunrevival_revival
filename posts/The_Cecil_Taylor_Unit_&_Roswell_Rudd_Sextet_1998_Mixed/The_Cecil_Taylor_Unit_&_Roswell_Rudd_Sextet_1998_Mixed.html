   "Everywhere,""Yankee No-How,""Respects," and "Satan’s Dance" constitute a reissue of Impulse! [AS-9126], Everywhere, originally recorded July 8, 1966 in New York by the Roswell Rudd Sextet. "Bulbs,""Pots," and "Mixed" were originally recorded October 10, 1961 in New York by the Cecil Taylor Unit, and those tracks appeared alongside several unrelated tracks by members of Gil Evans’ orchestra on Into The Hot, Impulse! [AS-9]. The original liner notes by Nat Hentoff and Michael Cuscuna, respectively, are included in the accompanying booklet.

   With stereo bowed basses setting the stage backdrop behind his full, expressive trombone tone, Rudd begins "Everywhere" wailing and moaning before inviting the full ensemble to join him. It’s a slow melancholy dirge that allows everyone to improvise while keeping the focus on Rudd’s solo voice. "Yankee No-How" contrasts with twelve minutes of group frenzy contained in a sphere of excited thoughts. Although the ensemble passes ideas from one to another, group cohesion is not as apparent as elsewhere. Resembling a pair of timpani, the basses thunder through "Respects" alongside the others, and combine with Rudd’s low pedal tones on "Satan’s Dance" for weird underworld effects. Three of the four Roswell Rudd Sextet tracks rely on group improvisation over any one individual voice.

   Cecil Taylor’s ensemble had much in common with the orchestra music of Gil Evans. "Bulbs" has form and focuses attention toward the featured saxophone soloists, while "Pots" looks to the pianist for rapid-fire percussive streams. Opening with a brisk walking-bass pattern and transitioning to a modified swing rhythm, "Pots" contains a fair amount of excitement. "Mixed" brings a larger ensemble with a fascinating sense of direction and cohesion. At times sharing a unison melody or riff, and at times improvising simultaneously, the ensemble provides a meaty subject and an enjoyable rainbow of sound patterns. The album stretches from readily accessible material to avant-garde fringe jazz. Recommended.

   A particularly strange album. This contains three tracks from the Gil Evans 1961 album Into the Hot, which, oddly enough, have nothing whatsoever to do with Gil Evans at all, but are instead a rather avantgardish performance by the Cecil Taylor Quintet (joined on one track by Ted Curson and Roswell Rudd). This is an energetic set, with some frantic piano work by Taylor and an electrified backing band featuring a young Archie Shepp in a wonderfully expressive mood.

   The remaining tracks are from Roswell Rudd's 1966 album Everywhere. The thematic link seems to be Rudd's presence on one of the Taylor tracks, otherwise this is a lot more conventional, despite the presence of Robin Kenyatta, Charlie Haden and Beaver Harris. Rudd, who played with Grachan Moncur III in Archie Shepp's band at the time, seems to try to emulate Moncur here occasionally, but when he does so, he fails to conjure up the same dark emotionality that Moncur is capable of. It's still an interesting, if slightly unfocussed album.

   The compilation feels a bit like an attempt to put the three excellent Taylor pieces into a better context than the misnamed "Gil Evans" album, but it still feels a bit arbitrary, and the great cover designs of both the Evans and Rudd album got lost somewhere on the way. Novices might be confused, and collectors may want the original albums, but musically this is nevertheless worth a listen.

   Two recording sessions without connections in one CD. The first, The Cecil Taylor's Unit set, was a seminal free jazz jam, recorded in 1961,  divided in three very distinct movements: "Bulbs", "Pots" and "Mixed". The personnel on this first half of the album is: Cecil Taylor, piano; Jimmy Lyons, alto sax; Archie Shepp, tenor sax; Ted Curson, trumpet; Roswell Rudd, trombone; Henry Grimes, bass; Sunny Murray, drums.

   The second part of the program, it's the entire Rudd's 1966 Impulse! "Everywhere" album. This set it's plenty of complex arrangement structures and fiery improvisations (there is a tribute to Eric Dolphy entitled "Respects"). Though Roswell Rudd never sounds like a Grachan Moncur III or a Curtis Fuller on trombone, your way to play it's exploratory and contemplative. The personnel joined to recorded that session was: Roswell Rudd, trombone; Robin Kenyatta, alto saxophone; Giuseppi Logan, flute and bass clarinet; Charlie Haden and Lewis Worrell, basses; Beaver Harris, drums.

   This release, obviously, presents a confused recording session dates compilation, and, actually, the Cecil Taylor's Unit set appears on a 1961 Gil Evans album called "Into The Hot".

  Too much content for an only one album, I think, but still a good stuff.
