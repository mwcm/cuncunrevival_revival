  This album is excellent. Forget VDGG, this is Hammill, and Hammill's records are different than VDGG records. This album contains some of his most beautiful love tracks re-arranged (some re-sung), and most of them are FAR superior than the originals (which were excellent in the first place). "My favourite" has additional instruments, which is exactly what it needed, "Ophelia" has a different mix with echoed vocals that gives it an extra spooky haunting feel, "If i could" has additional instruments (performed live if memory serves me well), "Vision", which is my favourite song, has additional violin which elevates it to a new height of sensibility, "The Birds" is re-sung with different vocals which makes it even sadder, "This side of the looking glass" is sung an octave or two below the original, which gives it a darker feel (orchestra remains the same). A full and accomplished album, and not just a "best of love songs" album. Excellent.
