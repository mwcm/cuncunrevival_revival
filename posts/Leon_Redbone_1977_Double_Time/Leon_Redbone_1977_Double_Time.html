   Leon Redbone followed up his debut long-player On the Track (1975) with Double Time (1977), an equally enchanting, if not somewhat eclectic blend, of jazz, folk, blues and pop standards -- all in Redbone's undeniably distinct throaty baritone. While the tunes may be familiar, these renderings are steeped in the artist's unique sensibilities. The results are uniformly ingenious and commence with a New Orleans ragtime flavored interpretation of Blind Boy Blake's dirty "Diddy Wa Diddie" blues. Augmenting Redbone's acoustic guitar is an extended cast of session stalwarts and a host of other musical notables -- such as Milt Hinton (bass), Jonathan Dorn (tuba), Vic Dickenson (trombone) and Jo Jones (drums). Don McLean (banjo) sits in, supplying his criminally underutilized instrumental versatility on the endearing revamp of Jimmie Rodgers'"Mississippi Delta Blues." The decidedly demented reading of "Sheik of Araby" is nothing short of inspired insanity. Redbone incorporates a Screamin' Jay Hawkins-esque persona belting out a variety of hoots, snorts, howls and hob-gobbles set behind a hot-steppin' fret board flurry à la Django Reinhardt. Among the album's most affective numbers is a cover of a second Rodgers' penned and similarly titled "Mississippi River Blues." This is one of the more intimately emotive performances on the record and features another jazz legend, Yusef Lateef (soprano sax) -- who provides a sweet understated counterbalance to Redbone's dogged delivery. The track is likewise enhanced with the additional textures of the orally generated "throat tromnet" [read: a cross between a trombone and trumpet] contrasting his lyrical yodels and warbles. Also worthy of mention is the languid ragtime of the Jelly Roll Morton classic "Winin' Boy Blues." Bob Greene's ramblin' piano inflections aptly complement the vocals -- which have been electronically manipulated to reproduce a sound likened to that of a vintage victrola. Rounding out the stack is the sublimely reverent "If We Never Meet Again This Side of Heaven." The backing harmonies are courtesy of the incomparable Dixie Hummingbirds whose rich blend oozes from behind the minimalist lead and acoustic piano accompaniment. Potential enthusiasts are well served to begin their discovery of Leon Redbone here.

   Leon Redbone's CD album "Double Time" features many favorites for the faithful, but two in particular stand out in my memory of this collection. The first is "The Sheik of Araby," which is iconic Redbone in its blustering, humorous take on this classic, one of the most popular songs from the era of the Flapper. The second number that stands out for me is, in my venerable opinion, the best recording I've ever heard of the song "Shine On Harvest Moon." I recall wondering when I saw the "Shine On" title on the album -- why would a Jewish boy from Brooklyn, a boy who'd grow up to give us a fresh, new look at the Blues, why would he choose this shmaltzy old-time sentimental piece for his album? You only have to hear his rendition of it to understand why. When that all-male chorus fades up behind his vocalization, we're totally into the romantic song Redbone has given new wings. The music soars, and we surrender ourselves to the innocence of a time long ago and the euphoria of loving our gal or our guy. This number, "Shine On Harvest Moon," is worth the price of the album, as they say, and it's the main reason for my gifting Redbone's "Double Time" CD album time after time after time.
