   Polish Jazz-Rock Fusion band Extra Ball was the best and most dominant ensemble on the local scene in the late 1970s. Founded by the best young Polish Jazz musicians at the time, members of the second generation of the country's splendid tradition, they displayed an amazing level of individual talents both as players and composers. Led by guitarist Jaroslaw Smietana, the initial incarnation of the band also included saxophonist Andrzej Olejniczak, keyboardist Wladyslaw Sendecki, bassist Jan Cichy and drummer Benedykt Radecki. Smietana and Sendecki wrote the material for this, their debut album, which is truly outstanding in every sense. The melodies are complex and well developed, covering a wide range of cultural influences, both from the Jazz tradition and from other sources like folklore and European Classical music and Rock. The level of musicianship is amazingly high, definitely well beyond what one might expect from people in their twenties. Smietana's superb guitar licks will amaze every Fusion fan, who was never exposed to his performances and Sendecki's keyboard wizardry is simply astounding. This is an excellent album, which all Fusion lovers on this planet should be proud to have in their collections. An absolute must!
