   Shigeru Suzuki is a well known Japanese guitarist who started his career in late 1960s. In 1969-1972 Suzuki played in Happy End, a short lived band that played folk rock. His bandmates in Happy end included Takashi Matsumoto, Eiichi Ohtaki and Haruomi Hosono (of the Yellow magic orchestra fame). After Happy end was disbanded, Suzuki played in Hosono’s new band Tin pan alley, a band concentrating on exotica styled music.

   Band wagon, the first solo album of Shigeru Suzuki, was released in 1975. Instead of folk rock or exotica, this album is funk and soul oriented. It was recorded in Los Angeles with additional local session musicians involved. Most of the tracks are vocal numbers but there’s also some instrumentals included. While Suzuki concentrates on slow funk jams, there’s also few funky midtempo soul songs. First track Suna no onna is very soulful funky song similar to the second one, Hachigatsu no nioi. Third track Binetsu shonen is a guitar driven midtempo groovy soul track. Few instrumentals include Suno ekusupuresu (read “Snow express”) and Uddo pekka (read “Woodpecker”), really funky mid tempo groovers. There’s also slow funk jams like 100 Watto no koibito and Yuyake hatoba) in the album. This is clearly one of the funkiest albums out of Japan, highly recommended.
