  This has been a true collectors item for many years changing hands for silly money (I've been outbid on ebay more times than I care to remember)mainly on the strength of the magnicently titled furiously funky breakbeat and clavinet driven"March of the Goober Woobers".
  <br/>
  As you can imagine I was delighted to see it's just been reissued on cd so I snapped one up at Dusty Groove and here it is in its magnificent entirety-all killer no filler!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Funky and free-thinking fusion from the Texas scene of the mid 70s – a great indie album by a group who travelled in the same territory as the soul combo Starcrost! Although American, the work here has some great qualities that remind us of some of the best European fusion from the same time – a sense of soaring, stretching energy – and one that never resorts to too much jamming to carry across its message, and which juxtaposes heavier rhythms with some gentler tunes that really allow the horn parts some wonderful moments! Instrumentation include soprano sax, tenor, trumpet, electric and acoustic piano, and a fair bit of percussion too – all recorded with a great sense of warmth, almost in the mode of some of the best Fantasy Records 70s sessions!
