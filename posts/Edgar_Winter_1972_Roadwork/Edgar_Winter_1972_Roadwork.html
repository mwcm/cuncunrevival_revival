  The live follow-up to 1971's Edgar Winter's White Trash finds the group running through a handful of the tunes from their debut album, as well as rocking things up a bit with "Still Alive and Well" (a track later recorded by Edgar's brother Johnny) and "Back in the U.S.A." One of the most immortal lines for any live rock album has to be "People keep askin' me -- where's your brother?" The introduction of guest artist Johnny Winter by his brother Edgar sets the stage for a rousing rendition of Rick Derringer's "Rock &amp; Roll, Hoochie Koo." The extended version of blues classic "Tobacco Road" is one of the finest moments on this album, which is itself a classic.

  Edgar Winter's finest album benefits greatly from some very talented guests.  Recorded live at L.A.'s famous Whiskey A-Go-Go, and New York's famed Apollo Theatre, this album is four sides of good Rockin' R&amp;B.  Some folks would call this "blue eyed soul" but with albino brothers Edgar and Johnny Winter maybe you should call it "pink eyed soul".  Whatever you call it, brother Johnny is just the beginning of those talented guests.  You're also treated to some fine guitar work from Rick Derringer, and very soulful vocals from one Jerry Lecroix.  Add some fine and funky horns into the mix and an great rhythm section, and you've got the makings of a fine group.  The first three songs, "Save the Planet", "Jive, Jive, Jive", and "I Can't Turn You Loose" are the highlights for me.  "Tobacco Road" is pretty good, but suffers from some over indulgence when Edgar Winter just tries too hard, and makes the song about 6 or so minutes than it should be.  Also I find Johnny Winter's appearance on "Rock and Roll Hoochie Coo" a bit sloppy.  The album ends well with a fired up version of "Turn On Your Lovelight" where Lecroix turns in his best performance.  I wouldn't call it the best live album of the 70's or even early 70's, but it's still pretty damned good stuff.
