   Alux Nahual (that's Spirit of the Goblin in mayan language) made their debut in 1981 and quickly became one of the most succesfull bands in the country. Their unique musical style completely separated them from the rest of the bands at the time, but far from getting disregarded by the public they attained a massive following of fans and admirers from all over Central America. Their distinctive approach to music is what makes them so very hard to categorize. Even though they are included in Crossover Prog, I would rather describe their sound as Prog Folk but that's just my opinion. Alux Nahual is really a fusion of different genres and styles blending rock music with mayan folk, blues, flamenco and many others.

   The album opens with the instrumental "Cola de Golondrina", a fiery piece filled with violin and acoustic guitar that shows the great talent of all the members. "A Ti" and "Un Poco de Paz" are both sung numbers and both display the folkier side of the band. The first gem of the album comes then with "Un minuto de Ilusion". All the instruments blend togheter perfectly to create great memorable melodies until the very end. The next song, "La Fabula del Grillo y el Mar" is simple in structure but it's beauty lies in the story it tells and the message one can learn from it. Finally, the last two pieces "Posada" and "Hombres de Maiz" bring the album to it's climax. The first one is slower and melacholic but perfectly executed. The later being the apex of the album, with high speed playing, swift tempo changes and wonderfull atmosphere. The best way to close the album. The only thing I regret is the raw sound quality of the recording but even so, it doesn't take away anything from the music.

   If you want to get to know the band this would be the ideal place to start. I highly recommend it to Prog Folkers but Alux Nahual has a particular way of pleasing anyone, no matter what type of music they listen to.

   This is a great album. It shows quite well the origins of this emblematic band. Is heavly oriented to the symphonic elements, with a lot of violin solos and usuall unisons between guitars, bass and cello. It's a very interesting album for people who likes to dive into a fresh atmosphere, music with sense and soul without a doubt. The first track, "Cola de Golondrina" is one great effort, mixing folk-fussion elements with symphonic and regular rock phrases. Great instrumental song. Other two standout tracks are "Un minuto de Ilusión" and "Posada". Both, nearly instrumental, 'cause the lyrics are quite short and give just what the song requieres to have an idea of the subject. Posada, speccially brings some interesting concept 'cause is based on a traditional phrase played in the Christmas hollidays with turtle percussion. The songs follows with guitar and violin solos. Maybe the best song of the album is the last one, "Hombres de Maíz", a seven minute song with a lot of symphonic parts. A very thoughtfull song that talks about the social life in Latin America. Great album, way above the average of the most latin rock, well written and with a lot of soul a meaning trhough the whole piece...

   Heavy on the strings, which is always something I enjoy in my prog rock.  I have to say that I was somewhat surprised by the relative lack of traditional Central American influence here.  Judging from the band's name I expected something along the lines of Luis Perez' imagined pre-Columbian soundscapes.  That would have been welcome but I definitely appreciated the somewhat more conventional, if classical tinged, prog folk-rock the band provides just as much.
