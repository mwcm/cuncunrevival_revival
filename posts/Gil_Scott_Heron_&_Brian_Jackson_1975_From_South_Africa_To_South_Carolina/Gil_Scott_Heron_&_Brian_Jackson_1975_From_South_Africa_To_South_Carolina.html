  A truly magical album by Gil Scott-Heron &amp; Brian Jackson. Next to Bridges this album is the most approachable, and definitely the most soulful from their back catalogue. Not a weak moment anywhere on here, and it's been reissued, so you have no excuse.
  <br/>
  A soulful, beautifully performed album that should serve as an inspiration to new artists to be politically active and engaged both in their private lives and in their music.
  <br/>
  The digital version also has some live stuff and the tune from the Sun City album (which is not that great and doesn't fit in at all, being mid 80s rap, which I have no patience for).
