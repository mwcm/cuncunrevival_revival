   This disc represents my first opportunity to have compositions for large ensemble available on record and I am grateful to the many people who have made this possible.  All of the compositions on this record were composed for this particular date and represent a cross-section of my work in this area.  I refer to this medium as Creative Orchestra Music both as a means to seperate this activity from my work in notated Orchestra music and also because I feel the phrase Creative Orchestra Music best describes this medium.  For to understand what has been raised in the progression of creative music as it has been defined through the work of the Ellington-Hendersons-Mingus's-Colemans-etc., is to be aware of the most significant use of the orchestra medium in the past hundred years (and some).

   It is difficult if not impossible for me to write about how I see by work in creative music, for I have never felt that words are meaningful when aplied to creativity\and yet something has to be written—for many of the mis-conceptions that surround creative music are still with us today.  For that reason I have written briefly on each composition with the hope that even a structural analysis can give the listener some idea as to how I conceived the compositions which comprise this record.  I would also like to thank the musicians on this record.  I consider myself fortunate to have had the chance to work with these people.  Who else would have played this music with so little rehearsal time (the average rehearsal time for each composition was a little more than two hours) and nobody had seen the music in advance.

   This is one of Braxton's most interesting recordings. Six of his compositions are performed by groups ranging from 15-20 pieces and featuring such soloists as trumpeters Cecil Bridgewater, Leo Smith, Kenny Wheeler and Jon Faddis, baritonist Bruce Johnstone, trombonist George Lewis, reed player Roscoe Mitchell, bassist Dave Holland, pianist Muhal Richard Abrams and Braxton himself. There is a lot of variety on this set. One of the pieces finds Braxton combining free elements with a Sousa-type march while another one looks toward Ellington. There are quite a few memorable moments on this program.
