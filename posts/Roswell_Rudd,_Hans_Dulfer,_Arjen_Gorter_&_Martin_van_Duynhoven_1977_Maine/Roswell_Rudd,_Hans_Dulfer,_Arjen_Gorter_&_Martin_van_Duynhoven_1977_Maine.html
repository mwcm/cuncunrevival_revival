   Here's a lively date from late 1976 at "de Kroeg" in Amsterdam featuring American trombonist Roswell Rudd with three Dutch players, Hans Dulfer on tenor sax, Arjen Gorter on double bass and Martin Van DuynHoven on drums. We have posted the three Dutch gentlemen before with Theo Loevendie, also in a quartet setting, most of it from about the same period as this date, mid- to late 70s.

   Only three pieces on this lp, first the title track which starts out with a simple repetitive bass motif, a joint chorus from the two main players and successive solos from all four, finishing with a drum solo with the bass motif underneath and a restatement of the main chorus at the end. This is a killer funky groove with all players riding on the main pulse of the piece with crackingÂ  rimshots from Van DoynHousen (and even a cowbell in there?). If jazz should invade the dance floor, this is a track to fire up the engine. The Rollins piece has Dulfer roaring away at full speed and Rudd taking it down in his solo in the second half of the piece (after turning the record, so to speak) and Van Duynhousen piledriving it again before the repetition of the chorus right at the end. The final Rudd is in a bluesy mode with Dulfer and Rudd again in the driver's seat, delivering some expert hard bop to round out the proceedings, Dulfer hotting it and Rudd cooling it.

   This is a hyperkinetic date, top speed ahead from all four and to me, Dulfer is a revelation, even over-powering Rudd at times, particularly on the Rollins piece. Sometimes you need a bit of coolness to balance the hotness, and the soloists do compliment each other nicely.

   Recommended, and to be played reasonably loud to appreciate the full dynamics of this wonderful date! And it's a topnotch recording to boot.
