   Led Zepellin &amp; Peter Grant were friends of many Pretty Things band members , and when Led Zepellin &amp; Grant decided to form a new label around late 1973 ...they called it SWAN SONG... their 2 first signed bands were first Bad Company then The Pretty Things...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As 2nd album released for Swang Song ...at the end of 1974 The Pretty Things released the dirty &amp; glamourous "Silk the Torpedo" released even before the monstrous "Physical Graffiti"... unfortunately without much commercial success... one year later it was time for "SAVAGE EYE"...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   1A) "Under the Volcano" ...it's a black &amp; red starter... Phil May's sing about his childhood memories... and how rock n roll started to take shape in his teenage lifespan... there's a fine chuckberryan solo at the middle with a monolotical rythmn (guitar) section a la Zepellin... but the best is really the end of the song with one of the best guitar solo of the record...it's a true wall of sound and that is pure rock n roll with many guitars playin' together ...it's a big kick in the ass for a starter...and naturally those 6 minutes are some of the best on the whole album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   2A) "My song" is a Phil May song, already the peak is reached after this 2nd song... it was my fave song on the lp for years ... and this is not as heavy as the previous song...it's really epic mid 70s pop rock...and surely it ain't no prog but personally i just don't care of the tags as long as quality is involved... The lyrics are kinda lightweight but at the same time it's perfect for the music...the music is majestic and really epic ...specially in the end... Skip Alan the drummer has made one of the best performance of his carreer on this one...waoowww
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   3A) "Sad Eye" is another rather quiet song and it is an heartbreaker , is is a Peter Tolson song... it's one of those good vintage melancholic song ( maybe as good as Rush "Tears" or Bee Gees "Don't wanna live inside myself"). There's a calm acoustic guitar and basic but brilliant (backing) vocals ...this guitar sound is like a sweet rain under a british late september sky...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It's one of the best song on the album but strangely i don't listen to this one as much as some others in the lp...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band was probably influenced by this song to choose the tittle of the album
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   4A) Heavier guitars are back for this "Remember that Boy"... the refrein is kinda pure rock n roll a la rolling stones circa 1974... the guitars are excellent here and the backing vocals too (is it girls or boys?... still not sure) ... i'm not that excited of the refreins but it's surely good enough... the rest is even better...and the end again rocks with those soulful backing vocals ...and killer guitars...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   1B) "It isn't rock'n roll"... is kinda old school... ...in a cabaret style... then full rock push the doors... personally not really a favourite ...because of the too classic rock n roll refrein... but at least the band seems motivated ... it's like if Elton John, Queen, the Pretty Things and Billy Joel goes wild together in a 1975 saturday night performance with 30 people watchin' them in a saloon...with at the end... chairs flyin' in the air...in the middle of so sober fights... rather funny...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   2B) "I'm Keepin'" is pure rock... A song that i have appreciated directly at first listen but who don't offer much more than that after many listenings...still Phil May again finally stole the show... good backing vocals again too... + they offer a good outro to the song... i love their excellent outros !
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   3B) "It's Been So Long" is the laid-back song ... relax take a drink at the balconny... burn a cigarette in slow motion... while watching the city lights... This song nearly reminds me some early recordings of english late 70s-early80s band Charlie... The Pretty Things goes really soulful here... it can even please some Dr John fans... still a decent song with a pleasant atmosphere but surely not so memorable...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   4B) "Drowned Man" is the only song that i don't like at all in this album...not all the instruments and ideas are bad in this song...but ultimately it just does not stick together...still sometimes this song is rather strange... it could be a Procol Harum c-side of that time !
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   5B) "Theme for Michelle" ...this is a rather short ...it's John Povey leading this piano instrumental song...simple and pleasant again but not much more...at least it close the album more decently ...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   The last album recorded by the Pretty Things before Phil May left; within months of this recording, the band split for a few years. Even more than Silk Torpedo, Savage Eye seemed to have been cannily devised with an eye toward picking up FM airplay in the U.S. There were hard rock, glam rock, and AOR rock influences from David Bowie, Queen, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney to be heard at various points, and while this album wasn't explicitly derivative of any of them, it didn't have much of a personality of its own, either. It certainly didn't sound like the Pretty Things, for gosh sakes. And although it went to number 163 on the charts and was one of only two records by the band to chart in the States, it was one of their least memorable.

   Surprisingly versatile and unfailingly melodic, this sounds like a distillation of FM radio from the mid-70's, with the ironic caveat that I don't remember any of these songs ever being played.  "Archetypal yet obscure" seems like a good description of the band, who apparently labored under some sort of commercial curse.  But they're a great band, able to go from hard, bluesy rave-ups to midtempo numbers with intricate, Beatle-y background vocals to sensitive, soulful ballads.  And that's just the first three songs.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At any rate, everything I've heard -- from S.F. Sorrow right up through 1980 (I haven't heard anything after that)-- shows a band with an instinctive grasp of music, most especially hard rockers, but also more intricate, almost proggy numbers, and always with plenty of hooks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A brief history:  they started in roughly the same territory as early Who and Rolling Stones (but with a harder, more garage sound), and rapidly expanded into Beatles and Kinks territory, culminating in 1968's S.F. Sorrow.  In the first half of the '70's they morphed into a highly versatile band that could sound like Yes, Queen, Thin Lizzy, and -- in their glam phases -- Bowie and Lou Reed.  And having started in the early 60's, they're co-inventing these styles along with other artists, not merely parroting them.  The only real weak link with these guys is some degree of filler and generic and/or depressing lyrics, but here the filler is minimal.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Overall, a great record from a criminally overlooked band:  these guys are to the Kinks as the Kinks are to the Beatles.
