   On May 31, 1979, a group of young musicians—performing under the banner Infinite Spirit Music and led by pianist Soji Ade (sometimes credited as Soji Adebayo) with conga player Kahil El’Zabar—took three cars from Chicago to the Soto Sound Studio in Evanston and, in a single day, cut Live Without Fear. In those few hours, the band mapped a sonic world without borders. The album was a bold expression of spiritual jazz, indigenous rhythms, and thoughtful Afrocentrism; every vibration feels touched by the spirit of Sun Ra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Like a lot of locally cut records at the time, Live Without Fear was released without much support and quickly became lost in time. Now, via Jazzman Records and its Holy Grail series, the album has been excavated for reissue, filling in a little piece of Chicago music history and belatedly showcasing the set forged by these hip young virtuosos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We were all similar in age, young guys who were listening to a lot of music,” remembers El’Zabar, speaking over the phone four decades later. “It was a goal and aspiration and ideal to be spiritually connected to the music you play, the musicians that you played with, and the community that listened to it. So it was, without being cliché, a very natural idea. The idea of the music for Live Without Fear, Infinite Spirit Music, was all in that sense of aspiration, so to speak.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The album intertwines various strands of 20th century Chicago musical history. Take El’Zabar himself. A native of the city, he came up rubbing shoulders with greats like Chaka Khan (once married to El’Zabar’s childhood musician partner Hassan Khan). El’Zabar lived across the street from legendary jazz composer Roscoe Mitchell, and counted Earth, Wind &amp; Fire horn players Don Myrick, Louis Satterfield, and Rahmlee Michael Davis as his friends. He played with cult soul star Baby Huey and his band The Babysitters, and shared bills with jazz legends like Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. It was a period when the city boasted a sizeable audience for all forms of Black musical ingenuity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At that time, this music was being played on the radio,” says El’Zabar. “There were large audiences across the hippie community, the so-called Afrocentric community. Everyone felt that the music had importance when it came to lifting the spirit. That was the energy [of] Infinite Spirit Music—not to be afraid, to live without fear, to go for what you believe in.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He continues, “We weren’t mimicking anybody else—we were taking influences and reinterpreting them as our own. It was that kind of confidence and thankfulness that everybody had. Like, ‘Yeah, this has got something.’”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The beautiful thing about these guys is their modesty and earnestness,” adds Gerald Short of Jazzman Records in an email. “They make music for the reasons it should be made, to communicate a message of peace and good feelings to those that hear it. There’s no compromise to commercial values. They don’t bend to trends and fashion. It’s pure art.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Live Without Fear was manufactured, LPs were sold and distributed around the local scene, and that was that. There are no hard narratives around why Infinite Spirit Music failed to find an audience outside of hardcore Chicago jazz fans. The stacks of private records of this type were often made spontaneously, and didn’t fit in with some kind of master plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There was no marketing hype, no promotional budget, no record company backing, no commercial pressure,” says Short. “Just some musicians and the music they made together.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ade has remained musically active. In 2008 he released the spiritually engaged album Asase Yaa and he currently performs live with Sura Dupart and the Side Pocket Experience. El’Zabar is currently preparing to release a new album with his long-time band, the Ethnic Heritage Ensemble. Almost simultaneously, one of his earliest records will be made available for reappraisal. But Live Without Fear is more than that. It’s a sonic footprint of an exciting time in Chicago music, marked by young cats who walked the Second City’s streets with a sense of wonder and motivation for ingenuity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “All the young musicians, you were challenging each other’s skills and techniques and discussing history. It was enormous stimulation that I believe created epiphany across various genres. Whether it was Earth, Wind &amp; Fire or Sun Ra, they were all speaking to spirituality, community and human upliftment through music,” says El’Zabar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’s no wonder that Live Without Fear ranks at number 27 in Jazzman’s “Holy Grail” series. As the title suggests this is spiritual music but it also represents a direct reference to the very roots of jazz. It follows in the wake of milestone albums that deployed vocals and assorted percussion, augmenting conventional jazz instrumentation to create dramatic soundscapes that may never before have been heard in contemporary music. Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite, John Coltrane’s Kulu Sé Mama, Archie Shepp’s, Yasmina, A Black Woman and Pharoah Sanders’ Karma represent some prime examples. Sun Ra’s Arkestra was obviously another, albeit highly idiosyncratic, influence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Given that the original album was produced privately and received sparse distribution, copies have subsequently commanded huge prices. Since its release in 1980 on the Ancient Afrika Records label, it has only been reissued once, courtesy of the Japanese Shout! label. The atypical length of the album was notable since most LPs averaged a maximum duration of 45 minutes, shared over two sides, but here there’s a little over 50 minutes worth of music.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gerald Short’s Jazzman label has reissued this ultra-rare record with the collaboration and blessing of its main protagonists. Pianist Soji Adebayo was the progenitor of Infinite Spirit Music’s Live Without Fear. His colleague on the record was the multi-instrumentalist Kahil El’Zabar, who was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), becoming its chairman in 1975.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There’s a range of styles on the album, oscillating from the subdued electro-jazz of Children’s Song and Bright Tune to the percussion-rich, vocal declamations of Ritual and Father Spirit, Mother Love. There’s also a reggae-infused rhythm pervading Rasta. Arguably the album’s apotheosis is its title track which at just over 10 minutes evinces a hypnotic groove laced with soulful vocals, soaring soprano sax and gratifyingly exuberant piano, culminating in an unrestrained percussive foray.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The meaning of the album’s title, Adebayo explains, is simply “to live in material reality with faith”. He also reveals in the new liner notes that his album was listed on the eBay collection of 100 most important self-produced records and called the “holy grail of spiritual African jazz”. Irrespective of any commercial aspects that the album’s rare status generated, this is important, heartfelt music which rightly should be venerated.
