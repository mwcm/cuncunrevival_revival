   Iconic West Coast jazz by the legendary trumpeter at the cusp of his career. Baker made a slew of recordings in his lifetime, but this is among the crème de la crème.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Trumpeter Chet Baker rose to prominence in the mid-1950's and continued to perform and record prolifically until the late 1980's. But his best work came early in his career. Baker was a long-term heroin addict, and much of his later output, which can sound tired and repetitive, seems to reflect the toll the drugs took on his mind and body.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Baker's playing as a young man was nothing short of ethereal. His approach was spare, so you won't hear dizzying displays of rapid-fire notes, and he generally played the instrument in its middle range, so you won't hear piercing high C's. There's a light, laid-back aura to his playing that makes it seem effortless. But each note has a purpose, each chorus a musical story of its own. Baker was a wonderful improviser, able to turn a Gershwin or Rogers &amp; Hart ballad into something even more beautiful than the original. But he could also generate pulse-pounding excitement on up-tempo numbers.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Trying to sample Baker's early work can be confusing, because the original recordings have been shuffled and re-issued so many times over the years. The result has been a bin full of "Best of" collections, many repeating some (but not all) of the songs on the others.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This disc will help us cut though the confusion. These are all tracks made in 1953, when Baker was 24 years old and on the cusp of his career. They also feature pianist/composer Russ Freeman, who contributed half a dozen tunes to the sessions.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Just to be sure you have the right disc, this is the one called Chet Baker Quartet featuring Russ Freeman, on the Pacific Jazz Records label. It has 25 tracks, beginning with "Isn't It Romantic" and ending with "Winter Wonderland."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   You'll notice that the tracks on this disc run only three minutes or so. That's because record companies were still making 78 rpm records along with long-playing (LP) records in the early 1950's, and those old 78's couldn't accommodate more than three minutes. Still, Baker and company manage to pack a lot of music into such a short window.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   You'll also notice that these are monaural recordings. (Stereo didn't become widely available for another decade.) But don't worry. Although the sound won't blow you out of the room, you'll find it crisp and clear.
