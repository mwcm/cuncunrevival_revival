   Although he is often overlooked and forgotten, Larry Young is one of the most talented and creative jazz fusion keyboardists of all time. His contributions to jazz-rock and progressive rock place him in an ultra elite group that includes Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Jon Lord, Joe Zawinul, Brian Auger and Keith Emerson.

   Many feel that the creation of jazz-rock was the result of hard bop combining with psychedelic rock, if that is the case, Young is one of the very few musicians who worked in all three fields. His reputation in hard bop is legendary, as he is considered a top innovator and leader who worked with many of the greats in the field including Grant Green, Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw and Sam Rivers. In the world of psychedelic rock, Young worked with two of the greatest, Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix. When jazz rock morphed into existence, Larry was on the front lines again playing with greats like Miles Davis, Tony Williams and Jon McLaughlin.

   Larry Young's recording career started in 1960 when he was just 19. His first bluesy hard bop recordings show a huge Jimmie Smith influence, but over the years Young's restless creativity pushed him more towards an abstract modal style influenced by John Coltrane. In the late 60s his career as a B3 jazzist for the Blue Note label finally came to an end and Larry became interested in the new sounds of progressive psychedelic jazz fusion.

   During the late 60s and early 70s Young was everywhere, recording for all the top musicians in the new jazz-rock genre, yet strangely enough you hardly ever hear his name mentioned at all. Part of the reason for this could be his strange unorthodox approach to the B3 in which he purposefully places himself in the background shifting the sound of the Hammond by pulling out and pushing in the drawbars to create rich tone colors and psychedelic effects. For a good example of this style listen to McLaughlin's Devotion or Santana-McLaughlin's Love Devotion and Surrender. Although Larry does not appear on Santana's Caravanserai, his influence can be heard in Greg Rolie and Richard Kermode's attempts to imitate him.

   In the mid-70s Larry returned to making his own albums, but what strange albums they are. 'Lawrence of Newark' is excellent abstract African jazz with a big Coltrane influence, but the recording seems to be rough and crude on purpose. His last two albums sound more like na√Øve experimental music from the late 60s than anything that was happening during the mid-70s when the albums were released. I really enjoy these two albums with their quirky mix of dated funk, early prog-rock, lounge exotica, very raw synth tones and low-fi production, but they do not get very high ratings amongst the jazz and fusion critics.

   There is a certain pathos that seems to go with Larry's life. After such a brilliant start as a star B3 player for Blue Note, his career seemed to slide into obscurity, even though he was working with some of the biggest names in jazz-rock. He was a member of Hendrix's last band, and stood to benefit from the massive exposure and money that would give him when Jimi suddenly passed away. In the 70s he seemed determined to stay obscure by releasing strange albums that seemed puposefully out of step with the times and then finally his tragic death due to neglect.

   Larry has always struck me as a wise and gentle old soul, someone who had a deep mistrust for materialism and insincerity, as well as someone who's own since of integrity would never let him compromise or sell out. Reast in Peace Larry Young, hopefully history will record and remember your incredible accomplishments in music.

   Organist Larry Young was 19 when he made this, his debut recording. Although he would become innovative later on, Young at this early stage was still influenced by Jimmy Smith, even if he had a lighter tone; the fact that he used Smith's former guitarist, Thornel Schwartz, and a drummer whose name was coincidentally Jimmie Smith kept the connection strong. R&amp;B-ish tenor Joe Holiday helps out on two songs, and the music (standards, blues and ballads) always swings. Easily recommended to fans of the jazz organ.
