    I've been looking for this one for a couple years, and it didn't disappoint. Imagine Chicago Transit Authority through the prism of late 60s Stax hard soul/funk. A lotta complex horn charts, acid fried guitar, and good god's 'n have mercy's. And their lead singer's a dead ringer for Terry Kath.

    And the award for most confusing discography goes to.... The Albert! Two albums, both self-titled, same year (OK, I see now that RYM is crediting this one as 1971 - though Discogs maintains the 1970 date), and on the same label. Yea, that makes it easy to research.

    The Albert definitely fall on the soul-jazz/pop side of the horn rock equation. But there's some really fine horn charts, hard guitar, and organ that separate this one from the pack. Also check out the well done sax and trumpet solos. So not the best the genre has to offer, but fans of same will want to investigate.

    I (Bill Elmiger) played bass on most of the album reviewed above--that was the first "The Albert" album. We formed in NYC as remnants of 2 Syracuse-based bands, Otis Smith and The All Night Workers along with The Tradewinds, Howie Wyeth's band. Howie added horns from Juillard, and we were just going to be a recording band with Otis as singer. When the band decided to tour, some of us left and the rest cut the second self-titled album which benefited greatly from the band having played live gigs together. In between, we recorded a jazz album called "The Teacher" with James Moody, and a single instrumental cover of "Didn't I Blow Your Mind this Time" with Moody. Otis went on to record a number of singles after The Albert broke up (can be found on YouTube), and Howie joined Dylan's Rolling Thunder tour. Barry Lazarowitz, the drummer, later toured in Janis Ian's band. Jay Thomas, one of the horn players, returned to Seattle where he has a Big Band. Steve McCord from the ANW played the "Spanish Grenada guitar" on "All Her Vows" reviewed above, and I still have that guitar which I later bought from Steve.
