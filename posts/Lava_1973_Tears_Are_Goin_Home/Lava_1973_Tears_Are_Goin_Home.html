  There are many German bands from the early part of the seventies that could be described as either Heavy-Prog or Krautrock and in my experience it's been a hit and miss affair. I just never know until I can hear the whole album over time to give a proper evaluation. LAVA released this one record in 1973 and Conny Plank produced and engineered it. He also plays a guitar solo on the track "Would Be Better You Run". This is a melancholic album with a vocalist that reminds me of CAN's Malcom Moody although the drummer sings on one track and sounds nothing like that. Three of the six band members are multi-instrumentalists as well.
  <br/>
  "Tears Are Goin' Home" opens with distorted guitars then it kicks in to an uptempo rocker with vocals sounding very much like HAWKWIND. Spoken words after 2 1/2 minutes as it settles back briefly then away we go again. "Crimes Of Love" is my favourite. The drummer sings and we get a laid back sound with a beat and floating organ. Flute before 3 minutes as that underlying power that is just below the surface bubbles up. It never bursts forth though. Amazing tune ! "Would Be Better You Run" has strummed guitar and vocals standing out. A catchy tune that is folky. "All My Love To You" is where we get a CAN vibe because of the groove and vocals. They repeat the title of this song a lot.

  "(I'm Just A) Mad Dog" is where the guitarist plays bass and the bass player offers up a guitar solo. Go figure ? Intricate sounds with not much going on really until before 2 minutes when almost spoken vocals come in. It picks up after 3 minutes. CAN comes to mind with that groove and we get harmonica too. Excellent track. "Holy Fool" is a melancholic song that has strummed guitar and reserved vocals. "Pice Of Peace" is the over 10 minute closer and my second favourite. Relaxed piano to open as cymbals and bass join in. Drums follow. The electric guitar is laid back after 3 1/2 minutes as the beat, bass and piano continue. A melancholic jam. More energy 7 1/2 minutes in then it settles right down a minute later to the end.
