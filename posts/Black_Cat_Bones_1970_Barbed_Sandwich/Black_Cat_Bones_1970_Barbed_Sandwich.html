    Some bands achieve a measure of infamy for their revolving door personnel policy, but the attrition rate Black Cat Bones boasted surely rivals the body count at the end of a particularly fervid game of Grand Theft Auto. Free’s Simon Kirke and Paul Kossoff – a founder member – were among the many notables who passed through the ranks of these Brit blues stalwarts, darlings of the Marquee club’s Friday Blues Nights in late 1967.

    By the time Barbed Wire Sandwich came along – recorded in 1969, released in 1970 – founding brothers Stu and Derek Brooks had been joined by lead guitarist Rod Price, vocalist Brian Short and drummer Phil Lenoir. As David Wells points out in his sleevenotes, the album appeared too late in the day to benefit from any residual momentum from the blues boom. Furthermore, the band’s general adherence to strict 12-bar patterns did little to distinguish them from the common herd. They could, however, stoke up an earnest head of steam on tracks such as Coming Back, driven by Lenoir’s particularly effective two-handed shuffle. Elsewhere, the stern, dry riffing of Save My Love and Good Lookin’ Woman would easily sit alongside anything from the first Black Sabbath album.

    Black Cat Bones were a typical British blues rock band playing late 60s raw progressive blues. Two of its original members, guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke, would later form their own band (Free). When they felt they had taken Black Cat Bones as far as it could go, they both left before the band even cut their sole album in 1969, entitled “Barbed Wire Sandwich”. Future-Foghat Rod Price joined in to fill the shoes of Paul Kossoff.

    The music reminds of early Foghat and Free for obvious reasons. Many of these tracks are heavy, stripped down blues numbers, but it’s a winning formula with soulful lyrics and nice musicanship. It is an excellent testimony to some of the best heavy blues rock of its time, a hidden gem full of soul and raw energy.
