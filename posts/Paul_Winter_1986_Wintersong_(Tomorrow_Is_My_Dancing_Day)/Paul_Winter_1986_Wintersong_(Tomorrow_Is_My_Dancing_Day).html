   Since I first listened to this album years ago I knew it would rank up there with "Icarus" as one of my favourite Paul Winter albums of all time (also one of my favourite of anybody's music). Recorded in one of his favourite places to play, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in NYC, and joined by his long-time friends and collaborators Paul Halley and Eugene Friesen (and others) the songs have that lightness-of-being and beauty that any fan of Paul Winter's has come to expect and will always appreciate. I have to confess that I don't just listen to it in the winter-time; winter just gives me an excuse to play it more often! If you enjoy consummate artistry, music that is uplifting without making you giddy, and want to listen to music that you can never be ashamed of and will want to share with others then get this. This CD goes with me whenever I travel. This year I am purchasing a few to give away as gifts.

   Dedicated to the spirit of giving and forgiving, this fine musical work from 1986 includes traditional songs from Sweden, Italy, England, France, Germany, the Appalachians as well as Bach's "Joy," plus "Beautiful Star" by Odetta. Instrumental in its entirety, Wintersong is music for dancing, loving, and being alive, full of joy and lyricism.
