   Wasa Express debut album came out just when what we today know as "Jazz Fusion" was born out of the ashes of what before was known as "Jazz Rock". The heavy shredding of Mahavishnu Orchestra and Return To Forever gave way to the slick elevator horns of Weather Report. And in the background disco loomed large. Wasa Express defied this trend with their guitar heavy sound wich works both to their advantage and to their disadvantage. They are obviously a bunch of really talented guys. Special credit goes to the drummer "Doctor"Åke Eriksson. Before we in Sweden had Tomas Haake and Morgan Ågren there was this guy, a real beast, who was very inspired by Billy Cobham (and i mean it, the kit he used during this time was basically a carbon copy of Cobhams 1977 Tama Superstar kit!). However, it is also evident that these guys come from a Rock 'N' Roll background and not a Jazz one. The best Jazz Fusion records in my book are those with a good swing to it (my top 3: "Birds Of Fire", "One Size Fits All" and "Crac!") the two opening tracks on this album has shades of this, but after them, not so much. The Rock overshades the Jazz most of the time. "Masseur" and "Doing The Kopraal" are both catchy but they really dont go anywhere. There is also a whole bunch of weird stuff on this album. "Woog Boog" is 70's blues rock in the style of ZZ Top, "Cadillac" is a terrible and unfunny parody of the old Hep Stars hit, "Brother Wet" is Country and "Adventure" is 60's Guitar Rock like The Shadows. Combined with the Funk songs that is about seven genres of music on one album already! Most of the song are good on their own but i thought i was listening to a Jazz Fusion album? Give this a spin on Spotify if you want to. Drummers will probably also find a lot to enjoy in Åke Erikssons mastery. But if you are interested in early Swedish Jazz Fusion i recommend that you pick up something by Made In Sweden or Jonas Hellborg instead.

   WasasExpress and specialy thir first album from 1977 selftitled is one of my fav albums from jazz rock with progressive passages from the '70's. I was realy surprised to se how low rated this album is, only few reviews and very negative, quite strange to me because I found the album very well performed in swedish style with a lot to offer. Having in the band well known members from progressive rock scene from the '70's not only from Sweden, coming each one from diffrent bands as Solar Plexus or Made in Sweden and conducted by the great drumer Ake Eriksson , the one who worked across the years with many artists was easy to come with a solid album, even was little late for this kind of music style to aproach in late' 70s. I like the album a lot, great rhythmic parts, great druming, fantastic keybords , a real gem I must say, at least for me, I don't find any bad pieces or unintristing moments founded by others. Each piece is diffrent to each other, bring something quite intristing in both progressive and jazz atitude, nice polirhythmic changes, some parts are funky some are fusion, some are progressive but melted in an uniqyue swedish way. Some highlits as opening track January man, Doing the kopraal , New tuna or Brother wet show how talented this band was, but with all that after this album, ok, even their second one is ok, but after that they gone towards to a more comeprcial phase, that cost them a lot and finaly disbanded in 1980. This album remains their best effort for sure, and one as in the booklet of the remaster CD in digipack format shows a classic album from swedish progressive/ jazz rock scene, plus it has a very funny and great aswell cover art. Good musicians, good album, but very underrated. recommended
