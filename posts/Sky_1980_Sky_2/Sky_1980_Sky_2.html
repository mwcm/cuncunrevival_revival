  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the late '70s, a former CURVED AIR member -Francis Monkman- and an academic guitar player -John Williams, this one from Australia- joined to Kevin Peek and Tristan Fry to create an instrumental band able to mix classical music and rock: SKY.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Playing their own pieces and making traditional music covers, they've got compliments as well as criticals: Musicians were really virtuosos, but compositions were "light" and not innovative, and sometimes they were called a "MOR" band (Mature Oriented Rock, an euphemism to "Music for Old People").
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As a reference for SKY's music, we can talk about EKSEPTION -a Dutch band who made, essentially, covers from classical pieces-, altough SKY was a little bit more "serious" in their arrangements (however, it's possible to find another rythms in "Sky 2", from jazz to ethnic music).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Sky 2", the second effort from the band, is a double LP released in 1980. The original vinyl had a first disc with SKY compositions: "Hotta": Powerful opening with lots of percussion. "Dance of the Little Fairies": The album's gem, really beautiful and delicated. "Sahara": Changing piece that flows between energetic and soft moments, with some Middle East hints. "Fifo": Subdivided in four parts, this 17 minutes suite originally occupied the 'B' side of the first LP. It's the most "rockier" theme in "Sky 2", adding atmospheric touches too. It isn't the best of the stuff.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The following are short themes ('A' side in the second vinyl), but two brilliant pieces were eliminated from the original edition (I guess time reasons, but it's really sad, because both "Gavotta" -harpsichord delicatessen- and "Andante" -Vivaldi on acoustic guitar- could be situated among the best tracks). Remained alive: "Tuba Smarties": Composed by Herbie Flowers, where the band demonstrate that humour sense is possible even in the middle of "serious" music, with a tuba as the main instrument. "Ballet Volta": A traditional theme magically played with a classical guitar, another little gem. "Tristan Magic's Garden": This was the piece to be removed. Really, the weakest point that broke the nice classical atmosphere. Just percussions and vibraphone, boring and noisy. "El Cielo": Happily, this wonderful traditional piece returns to the listener the lost climax.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Closing the album, SKY reserved three excellent gifts: "Vivaldi": A classic in the band's discography, four minutes where Vivaldi's baroque music is played in a rock tempo (it was already played by CURVED AIR). "Scipio ( Parts I &amp; II)": Composed by Flowers too, gives to the listener twelve very interesting and changing minutes. Not very complex, but really pleasant and with a fantastic end. "Tocatta": Another version from Bach's well known piece, very nice.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Summarizing, "Sky 2" is an excellent album, not complex but specially interesting for those who like classical music with rock rythms.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Most Sky fans regard this as the peak of the band's output, and with good reason. There are ver few weak spots here, which is unusual for a double album. I now have the CD release, but I will speak of "sides" because I first discovered this album in LP form, it being 1980. At the time I first encountered Sky's music, I was already a fan of John Williams' classical guitar playing, so this melding of classical guitar with prog rock was just what I was looking for, particularly at a time when bands such as Yes and Genesis were in decline.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The first side contains the high-energy Hotta, the charming Dance of the Little Fairies, and the intriguing Sahara. The second side (taken up entireley by the "Fifo" suite) is the weakest side, owing to the middle two movements. The suite is inexplicably titled "Medley" on the CD release, but the LP shows the correct title.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   My favorite side is the third side. This is where the magic happens, for two reasons. The first reason is that the pieces here represent the solo talents of various band members. This approach was previously used on albums such as Yes's "Fragile" and Pink Floyd's "Ummagumma"; I don't know whether its use here is a conscious attempt to emulate those works or not. The second reason is that the mood on these pieces are much more introspective, a perfect foil to the faster tempos, higher volumes, and electric instrumentation of the other sides. My personal favorites on this side are the Ballet/Volta and El Cielo.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Finally, the more robust music returns on side 4, with "Vivaldi" (it is interesting to contrast this performance with the wilder original versions by Curved Air). Scipio isn't as powerful, but the non-stop appearance of new melodic material keeps a lot of momentum going (12 minutes worth). Finally there is the Tocatta. Of course, I'd rather hear this piece in its original form, on a pipe organ, but what we get here is a respectable rock rendition.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On the CD, I heard a slight hiss on quiter pieces, which is probably most noticeable on "Tristan's Magic Garden". Nothing too annoying.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Another curious bit of trivia: When the original LP was released in the US, it was released with the title "Sky", as if the first Sky album never existed.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The fact that a double album of instrumental music delivers so much good music, and so little filler, earns this five stars. The band's other albums just don't quite deliver as much, although the first and third albums have their charms.
