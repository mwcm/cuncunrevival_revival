  In addition to his prowess as a drummer, Art Blakey is probably best known for his ability to select and willingness to nurture talented young musicians who would, after their time in his Jazz Messengers, go on to become some of the strongest composers and leaders of all time; perhaps nowhere is this generosity towards the development of others more on display than it is here on "A Night in Tunisia". Never one to hog the spotlight simply because his was the name at the top of the bill, Blakey turns much of this set over to his youthful side men, allowing them to shine not only through their playing, but also by letting them express their creativity through their compositional skills as well. As a result, Morgan, Shorter and Timmons all get to showcase their burgeoning talents (with Shorter's "Sincerely Diana" and Morgan's slow-smoldering "Yama" being two of the standouts here), and the end result is a superior set of classic Hard Bop filled with catchy riffs and extended solos that is one of the Jazz Messengers' best.
  <br/>
  Art Blakey &amp; the Jazz Messengers hit their artistic peak with the powerful A Night in Tunisia. This incarnation of the group included Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Timmons, and Jymie Merritt along with their leader, Blakey. As the Messengers entered their most fruitful period for Blue Note, Blakey drove his men relentlessly with powerful grooves, heavy swinging, and shouts of encouragement. This session documents the full power of his assertive leadership and the masterful playing of his sidemen, each rising to legendary status under his tutelage. Long known for their creative arrangements within the context of small-group jazz, the Messengers push the definition of hard bop and blues to the limit here. Dizzy Gillespie's title track is evidence enough of the creative power of this group: Blakey's steam shovel-like mambo, Morgan and Shorter's wailing solos, and a dramatic ending make for a stunning piece. Shorter's contribution includes the swinging "Sincerely Diana." The soulful Bobby Timmons presents his delightful "So Tired," a bluesy number in the spirit of his classic "Dat Dere." Also included are Lee Morgan's smoky "Yama," the bouncing "Kozo's Waltz," and the classic "When Your Lover Has Gone."

  A couple years after the legendary Moanin,' Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers showed us they were still at the top of their artistic game with 1961's A Night in Tunisia (the groups second album to be titled as such). Blakey transforms the Dizzy Gillespie standard from which the album gets it's title into a roaring, extended hard bop anthem that offers some of his best, wildest, most exhilarating drumming since he put The Thunder Drum Suite to tape. The group then continues the energy with the hard bouncing and swinging Sincerely Diana and gets deliciously bluesy with So Tired before getting mellow and moody with the "smokey" (as it's been described) Yama, a fantastic little ballad, before returning the tempo with Kozo's Waltz. While Moanin' remains Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers most essential and all around best work, A Night in Tunisia is quite excellent and worth checking out.
