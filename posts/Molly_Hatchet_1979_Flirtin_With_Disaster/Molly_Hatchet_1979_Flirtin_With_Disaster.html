   Their stellar sophomore album, October 1979’s ‘Flirtin’ with Disaster,’ would ably fill the void — led by its No. 42 title track, which remained on the Billboard charts for 10 weeks. ‘Flirtin’ with Disaster’ also helped solidify the momentum built around Molly Hatchet’s eponymous debut from ’78, which had clawed its way to a platinum certification. Their follow up went one better, crashing the U.S. Top 20 on the way to double-platinum sales.

   The LP’s opening rocker ‘Whiskey Man’ welcomed fans back for a trademarked shot of their muscular sound. Then, a foot-tapping cover of ‘It’s All Over Now’ — as written by soul man Bobby Womack and made famous by the Rolling Stones — confirmed the group’s twin influences in American roots music and the British invasion. Next, ‘One Man’s Pleasure’ laid down reams of slide guitars, while subsequent tunes like the catchy ‘Jukin’ City,’ the cowbell-assisted ‘Gunsmoke,’ the riff-driven ‘Good Rockin’’ (think honky tonk Kiss!), and the self-explanatory ‘Let the Good Times Roll’ all celebrated weekend nightlife below the Mason Dixon.

   The late-album highlight ‘Long Time’ took a more somber approach, with memorable results, while Molly Hatchet’s side-one closer ‘Boogie No More’ unexpectedly turned on a dime and went from nondescript shuffle to a triple-threat guitar jam of epic proportions — courtesy of resident shredders Dave Hlubek, Steve Holland and the great Duane Roland. This song would come to life on stage, as Molly Hatchet tirelessly toured the country in the years to come.

   Then there was the title track, which came to epitomize the Molly Hatchet approach with its risk-taking moxy and Marshall stack power. ‘Flirtin’ with Disaster’ remains the band’s signature moment all these years down the line, and a mandatory staple of their concerts.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Finally worth mentioning, because it completed the picture (literally!), was another striking piece of album-cover imagery — courtesy of notable fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Entitled ‘Dark Kingdom,’ it convinced droves of red-blooded teen males to check out Southern rock’s next potential champions, as they battled beast and bands alike, in their quest to sit on that coveted throne.

   With three guitars aflail, Danny Joe Brown's biker-stepdad growl and Frank Frazzetta's marauding Viking album cover, Molly Hatchet hawked grimy southern-rock with a heavy-metal glint. On 1979's triple-platinum Flirtin' with Disaster, produced by rock vet Tom Werman (Ted Nugent, Cheap Trick), that meant faster, heavier and gnarlier — Eric Church and Randy Houser would be crouched in a corner, awestruck. The riff-lash of "Whiskey Man" revved the engine and "One Man's Pleasure" got furiously funky like Florida-Georgia Line wished they could; but the title track's ferocious jailbreak clinched it, with the FTW edge of Brown's existential lyrics deepening the band's switchblade choogle. Plus, Brown could've been addressing bro-country's smalltown throwdown when he barked, "Come on, heeeah!" during the gleeful stomp of "Boogie No More." These boys knew how to make a stadium as homey as a honky-tonk.
