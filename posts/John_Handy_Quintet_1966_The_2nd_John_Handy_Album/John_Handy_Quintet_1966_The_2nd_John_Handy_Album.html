   This mid-’60s group featured Jerry Hahn, Michael White, Danny Thompson and Terry Clarke, all players who have gone on to other significant achievements. The group chemistry is the main point of interest for jazz listeners (Handy and Charles Lloyd were about the only jazz players that appealed to the hippies, for some reason, and some of the material is accordingly on the light side.) Handy is also a master of the sax and his cohorts rate high as soloists and even higher as group players, all of which assures a deserved continued interest, and three previously unheard tracks add to that. But if one long (13:46) piece ever made a record worth buying, “Scheme #1” here is surely that piece. Handy said in the original notes that the group wanted to go more in this experimental direction, which sounds as much like Schoenberg or even at times Stockhausen as it does free jazz, though Handy in 1966 had digested aspects of Coltrane’s later work that most of his imitators still seem unaware of. The group’s togetherness raises this performance to a level no other third stream music ever reached. Too bad they split up without building on it.

   Handy put together one of jazz's most unique cooperatives for an unfortunately short-lived period in the mid-'60s. While the commercial climate wasn't kind to the band, they nonetheless produced some superb music, originally recorded on Columbia and now reissued on Koch. This release finds the quintet continuing to explore new ground.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Handy, one of our finest and most underappreciated altoists, surrounded himself with musicians no less free-thinking than himself, most notably the superb guitarist Jerry Hahn and the fine violinist Michael White. The band was capable of moving effortlessly through through jazz, rock, blues and free material. Their willingness to push the boundaries of jazz is demonstrated most clearly on "Scheme #1," which concluded the original vinyl release. It is a wonderfully realized exercise in musical abstraction, but its free quality doesn't mean that it's aimless or chaotic. In fact, Handy wrote several sections for the piece. Rather, the piece moves about in ways that invite the listener to make his own connections between the statements made by each band member.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The freedom of "Scheme #1" is balanced by some serious cooking from all involved. Hahn is astonishing on "Blues for a High-Strung Guitar" and Handy's playing on "Dancy Dancy" should make everyone wonder why he has received so little recognition during the course of his career.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The best blendings of jazz talents show the listener that telepathy does indeed exist. This tightly fused band deserved many more opportunities to weave their magic.

   Altoist John Handy's second Columbia album was actually his fourth as a leader. Utilizing the same musicians who had joined him during his sensational set at the 1965 Monterey Jazz Festival (violinist Michael White, guitarist Jerry Hahn, bassist Don Thompson and drummer Terry Clarke), Handy performs five of his complex yet accessible originals, which include the "Theme X" (in 5/4 time), the catchy "Blues for a Highstrung Guitar," and the adventurous "Scheme #1." The CD reissue adds three previously unissued alternate takes to the earlier program. This would be the unit's only studio album, and after disbanding, they did not reunite until 1994. The memorable music is highly recommended.
