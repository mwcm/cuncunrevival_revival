    <b>
     The New York Art Quartet history according to Roswell Rudd
    </b>
   </u>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I think it was late ’63 when Don Cherry suggested I check out an altoist named John Tchicai performing with his group in a midtown (NYC) Tchicai soon after. We just started playing and it sounded good right away. Then not too long after that John asked me to write some arrangements of music by Cecil Taylor and Thelonious Monk for a band involving himself, Don Cherry &amp; Archie Shepp (which I did and I’ve been told some were recorded.) The next thing that happened John arranged for himself, me and Milford Graves to work out in a loft in my neighborhood = lower lower west side. Again, we first started playing and it sounded good right away and it got better. Next time we got together I asked bassist Lewis Worrell to come along and we just started playing, and it took off again.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The name New York Art Quartet was something John ran by us, and my first impression was “too uppity, not funky enough for a jazz band” but damned if I or anyone else could come up with anything better. And the more I thought about the total improvisation that we had been doing (no prestructure of any kind up to that time) the more sense the word “art” made…even “the jazz” I had been playing all along was based off tunes, compositions, arrangements, suggested formats, etc. With the NYAQ we started, we listened, and responded to what each other was doing as we played and that was “the composition.” Of course written and head compositions were inevitable but all that free playing from the inception of the band was always the predominant thing. Over the summer of ’64 we kept rehearsing periodically and there were a few gigs.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the fall we made our first recording; for Bernard Stollman’s ESP label . In addition to heads by John and myself, and a great deal of free playing, John invitted Amiri Baraka to join us and he did a reading of his work Black Dada Nihilismus on the Sweet V. track which is a gem of the times and made that ESP date particularly special. We also performed as part of the Bill Dixon/Cecil Taylor brainchild October Revolution in Jazz at the Cellar Cafe. This evolved into the Jazz Composers Guild and Four Days in December at Judson Hall with periodic performances at the Edith Stephen dance studio up over the Village Vanguard which lasted well into the spring of ’65. With help from abroad, John organized a recording at Rudy Van Gelder’ s studio… Lewis Worrell was unavailable and Reggie Workman very capably filled his shoes. John also invited Amiri Baraka to sit in with us and we did “Black Dada Nihilismo. ”

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This was soon sold to Phillips Fontana and became Mohawk. John then returned to Denmark and by the Fall ’65 had set up a short tour beginning at the Montmartre Club in Copenhagen and included performances for Danish Radio on the same bill with Oliver Nelson and at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam opening for Ornette Coleman. (Milford Graves and Lewis Worrell could not make the trip, so the band at this time consisted of John, myself, a Danish bassist Finn Von Eyben and Louis Moholo on drums.) Later on that year back in the States two concerts stand out: one at the New School with Richard Davis on bass and a collaboration with the great avant cellist Charlotte Moorman at Carnegie Recital Hall. But by the beginning of ’66, John had returned permanently to Denmark …he did however make all of us a final offer to incorporate permanently and go into the future with him, but I at least could not make the commitment to exclusive contract at the time, as beautiful as the offer was; I wanted to keep myself as open as possible to a variety of experiences. In sum I wish to stress more than anything else the phenomenal blend and complementarity that was there from the inception with John &amp; the other great players. It was simply: great preordained organic chemistry.

   Alto saxophonist John Tchicai co-formed the New York Art Quartet in 1964 out of the ashes of the New York Contemporary Five. Enlisting trombonist Roswell Rudd (who arranged some of the latter group's book), the NYAQ was initially to include the Five's rhythm team of bassist Don Moore and drummer J.C. Moses. However, once drummer Milford Graves sat in, the group's pan-rhythmic die was cast. A number of bassists past through the ensemble in its short life — in addition to Lewis Worrell (featured here), Steve Swallow, Eddie Gomez and Reggie Workman occupied the bass chair. On the heels of the present album, they recorded once more for Fontana (the excellent and boppish Mohawk, with Workman) before disbanding until a brief reunion at the start of the millennium.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   One of the things that always set the group's ESP date apart from contemporary brethren is its inclusion of a poem, "Black Dada Nihilismus" by Amiri Baraka(LeRoi Jones), which is woven into the group's fabric. "Nihilismus" is a beat follow-up to Eliot's "The Wasteland" in the clothes of mid-60s New York, "cool" as dead, disheartened and disaffected with no place in any artistic or racial community, yet somehow affirming singularity as solitude. In a way, the inclusion of Baraka's (Jones) poem perfectly mirrors the in- betweenness of the group, who certainly had grand claims as to their music as art-music, creative and experimental, but whose approach to that very artfulness was always brusque and extremely "street."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The horns sit out for "Nihilismus," which is propelled by the thrum of Worrell's bass and Graves' telepathic burbling accents, a true collective music-poetry exploration that soon erupts into Rudd's "Sweet." Rudd and Tchicai are in loose unison on the easy-tempo theme, Graves in a continual hum of activity often at odds with the front line. Somewhat analogous to Anthony Williams, whose dissection of meter acted as the fulcrum for a number of groups at the time, Graves is defiantly in his own orbit. Rather than providing a canvas to free the soloist a la Sunny Murray, Graves is impulsive and either ignores or counteracts the soloist with non-isometric phrases, creating tension through non-unison collectivity. Yet there's propulsion and swing by dint of disparity, a pulse that's kinetic even if it's multidirectional. Tchicai's "No. 6" grooves mightily, even if Graves' dense patterns aren't countable by traditional means.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Graves' counter-melodic approach to rhythm isn't the only way in which the ensemble moves at odds. Rudd and Tchicai are a curious foil, a clash of slushy tailgate, buzzing and vocal, with cool-toned, acrid and poised alto. Tchicai, who studied with the late Steve Lacy, has more in common with the free-associative burble of Lee Konitz than Dolphy or Ornette. Cooking through contradiction, the New York Art Quartet cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground.

   Roswell Rudd assembled the newly formed New York Quartet for an afternoon recording session at Bell Sound Studios in midtown Manhattan. They were joined by a small, youthful appearing individual, the poet Amiri Baraka. Their engineer was the late Art Crist, an accomplished pianist. I was introduced to Lewis Worrell, Amiri Baraka and John Tchicai. The group was short lived. I heard them again 40 years later, when they reassembled for a concert at the South Street Seaport in New York City, opening for Sonic Youth at the invitation of Thurston Moore. -- Bernard Stollman

   One disc 43 minutes approximately. Digitally remastered-the sound is clean with good spatial separation among the instruments. This recording features Roswell Rudd-trombone,John Tchicai-alto sax,Lewis Worrell-bass,Milford Graves-drums and percussion,and on track two-Amiri Baraka(Leroi Jones)who recites a poem over a subtle background of music. The poem is strictly out of the sixties and is an example of how jazz was used in conjunction with the spoken word,and is valuable for that reason. This track is also the shortest on this set,about three and a half minutes. The music on the rest of the tracks is unstructured and atonal.

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is a perfect example of "outside" music that was touted as "the new thing" in the sixties. Fans of this style of jazz will find much to their liking here. The first track is used as a setting of style for the rest of the tracks. Track three starts off hesitantly but quickly finds a groove(if this music can have a groove),and finds all the players using their instruments to weave a subtle pattern of sound. The other tracks find the players playing over,with,and against each other-either "all-out" or with great subtly. The presence of Milford Graves on these sides gives this music a good grounding-he never lets things get out of hand. The same could also be said of Lewis Worrell-his bass playing,both within the group and on solos, is always just right. As for Rudd and Tchicai,their playing is always intelligent combined with a real feel for the music. Being totally subjective here,it seems to these ears and mind that each track,starting with track three,gets better and better. There is a subtly and a deep feeling in the music,that seems to increase. By the time the music has ended,there is a feeling of wanting more,or not wanting the music to end. On reflection,isn't that what we want in a listening experience?

   The notes are short and to the point. Rudd formed this group for an afternoon recording session. They were joined by Baraka. The group played again forty years later,opening for a Sonic Youth concert at Thurston Moore's invitation. As it seems to happen,Worrell had vanished from the scene and was replaced by Reggie Workman on bass. This is another example of why ESP RECORDS was,and continues to be important. From the music,to the album graphics-this is a nice package. It's good to hear it again and again. For more good music of this sort,look for NEW YORK EYE AND EAR CONTROL on ESP RECORDS

   This adventurous, short-lived quartet only made three albums in its two-year heyday. The best and most easily obtained (although that's relative) is the classic 1964 self-titled free jazz excursion on the ESP label. The unique front-line horn arrangement of trombonist Roswell Rudd and Danish alto saxophonist John Tchicai weaves rapid intricate lines around Lewis Worrell's bass and the frenzied drums of Milford Graves. Poet Leroi Jones (now Amiri Baraka) is added to the quartet for his revolutionary/militant spoken word diatribe "Black Dada Nihilismus." While it may sound like an intrusion to some listeners, it must be kept in mind that Jones was an active participant in the early avant-garde scene of New York, making his contribution to this disc vital in capturing the radical surroundings in which the music thrived. In 2000, the intensity and fervor was still thriving as the original New York Art Quartet (with Baraka, sans the late Worrell) reunited for their 35th Reunion concert, available on the DIW label.
