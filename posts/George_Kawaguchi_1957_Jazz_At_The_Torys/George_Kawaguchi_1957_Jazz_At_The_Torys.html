    Born on June 15, 1917 in Fukakusa, Japan, as a child Joji Kawaguchi (who later performed and recorded as George Kawaguchi) was raised in Dairen, Manchuria, returning to Japan after World War II. In the late '40s he first played drums professionally, turning naturally to the newly popular jazz that came with the American occupation. During the '50s and afterwards, Kawaguchi played most often with his own bands, including the Big Four and the Big Two. He also accompanied visiting American musicians, including fellow drummers Art Blakey (in 1981) and Elvin Jones (in the early '90s). His penchant for working with other drummers included recording sessions with countryman Motohiko Hino. A very strong player with a commanding technique, Kawaguchi enjoyed extended solo excursions, often with crowd-pleasing results. In the right company, however, and with his enthusiasm under control, he applied his considerable technique to the services of the band with great effect. George Kawaguchi died in Tokyo on November 1, 2003 after suffering a brain hemorrhage; he was 76 years old.

    That's Torys, as in Suntory's – the big Japanese distillery who's hosting this special performance of The Big Four – a crackling lineup that features soulful tenor from Hidehiko Matsumoto and drums from George Kawaguchi! The core group have an energy that's like the best American bop combos of the 50s – and they wail away beautifully at the start of the set, then pick up some additional sounds from guest musicians who include Sadao Watanabe on alto and Akira Miyazawa on tenor – plus a bit of vibes and vocals as well.
