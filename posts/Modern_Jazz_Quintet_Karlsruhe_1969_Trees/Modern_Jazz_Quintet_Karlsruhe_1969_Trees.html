   The MJQK started mid-sixties as a bop orientated group. Mainly through Joos they began to add freer and more personal concepts into the groups music.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All members were amateurs (not in the sense of being unable but simply they had "daily" professions). For example Helmuth Zimmer was an architect and Rudi Theilmann is a art historian.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   They made two lps as MJQK. After Claus Bühler the bassist left the group during a concert two more were recorded as "Fourmenonly" (Vol.1 &amp; Eight Science Fiction Stories). Arguments about loudness and the general direction the music went induced the split. The compilation "Born Free" from the 12th German Jazzfestival (these Lps were in fact a bootleg - none from the musicians were asked for permission or received any royalties) and a sampler from the NDR broadcast station (NDR Jazzworkshop '73) included each one piece by MJQK (abridged) &amp; Fourmenonly. Apart from this I know only one bootleg with about 20 minutes music.

   In contrast to some FMP artists their music was more thematic orientated and powerplay was used only sparingly to highlight formal contrasts. Their use of multitracking was unsual and led to negativ critic from musicians,journalists and listeners alike. But for achiveving more complex textures and/or backgrounds they used this method spontaneously from "Position 2000" onward. Basically Herbert Joos said that they would use such procedures to create the music they wanted without a greater assemblage of musicians which were not available or compliant.
