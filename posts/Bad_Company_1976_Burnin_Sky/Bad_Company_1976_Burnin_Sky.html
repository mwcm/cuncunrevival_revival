   Bad Company returned to France in 1976 to record their fourth album 'Burnin Sky' although this time they chose Le Chateau Studios in Herouville. It was the first time they had used a proper studio rather than a mobile set in a grand location.

   It is clear almost from the outset that the three albums in as many years had taken its toll on the bands main composers Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs as the material here is once again mostly not up to the high standards of the first two albums. Thats not to say it doesn't have its moments though.

   In fact the album starts in classic Bad Company style with a crash of thunder heralding the beginning of the title cut. A song which is on a par with the tracks from the first two albums and is head and shoulders above anything else on offer here. 'Morning Sun' harks back to the Free days and with its jaunty melody it occasionally brings 'I'll Be Creepin' to mind. 'Leavin You' is more typical of the Bad Company sound but lacks conviction in places and could have done with a more punchy mix to these ears at least. 'Like Water' is another song that sounds more Free than Bad Company although that is not surprising given that Rodgers co-wrote it with then wife Machiko Shimizu during the Free days. In fact it was one of the few tracks recorded by Rodgers band Peace during the Free split. The original can be found on the Free box set 'Songs of Yesterday'. After a brief interlude of 'The Happy Wanderer''Everything I Need' ends the original side one in a sort of 60s rock n roll style complete with spoken word bridge which is corny to say the least. It is almost a cross between the two Zeppelin tracks 'Dyer Maker' and 'Hot Dog' !!!

   Boz Burrell lays down a really funky bass line on the grooving rock track 'Heartbeat' that opens up side two before things go a little more laid back with the Simon Kirke penned 'Peace of Mind' and the woefully short but nevertheless pleasant 'Passing Time'. The heaviest track follows in the shape of 'Too Bad' an out and out rocker which was written by Mick Ralphs despite several CD issues mistakenly crediting it to Rodgers. Another Ralphs composition 'Man Needs Woman' keeps the tempo high for another three and a half minutes or so and although nothing spectacular it is decent enough and benefits from some good Mel Collins sax. The final track 'Master of Ceremony' is undoubtedly one of the strangest tracks on a Bad Company album. A seven minute funky jazzy bluesy groove at first it sounds completely out of place but it just grows and grows ensuring that 'Burnin Sky' is top and tailed by its two best cuts.

   'Burnin Sky' didn't fare as well as the first three albums sales wise but as it was released in the punk year of 1977 that might not be quite so surprising. Like the previous years 'Run With The Pack' it lacked a radio friendly hit in the shape of a 'Can't Get Enough' or a 'Feel Like Makin Love'. In fact the only single released from the album was an edited version of the title track which failed to make any impact whatsover. 'Burnin Sky' is most certainly Bad Company's most different album and it is obvious that ideas were at a premium. The brevity and lack of direction on some of the tracks along with a muddy at times disappointing mix from Chris Kimsey didn't really help and although 'Burnin Sky' is still a fine rock album it is, like 'Run With The Pack', a step down from the first two albums.
