   Man, this album always puts me in a great mood every time I play it! Although comprised of only a few tracks and long running times on most, it's really hardly one of their more progressive releases, rather it's just a damn good collection of superb 70's rock played by terrific musicians and a top- notch charismatic vocalist in the form of Bernd Noske. He has a sensational presence on this album, with a mix of gruff, confident and even romantic vocals. The LP is full of extended instrumental jamming amongst mostly straight-forward arrangements, with plenty of super-thick fuzzy organ, funky grooving guitars, commanding drum-work and aggressive bass playing.

   What an opener `Titanic' is! Despite some borderline offensive and downright cheesy lyrics ("I've got a sinking feeling..." is particularly memorable!), it's overloaded with fiery bluesy-rock guitar work from Bruno Frenzel, wavering lead vocals, humming Hammond organ, powerful brooding drumming and even a vocoder/guitar back and forth in the middle for good measure! Best track on the album, and it always makes me smile.

   Some will not enjoy the obviously funky/disco inspired bass playing on this album that first pops up on `Saturday Special'. Don't be put off by the fact that the track is a rather upbeat crowd-pleasing number, there's still plenty of spots for killer quick little lead guitar fills, very upbeat synth soloing and rattling percussion.

   `Seems Like Confusion' is another stomping funk-rocker, made memorable by Bernd really shredding his vocal chords throughout the piece and the spiralling swirling extended keyboard/synth improv in the middle over the bouncing rhythm.

   The strutting and punchy `Fight For You' is a real highlight! Cock-sure and crooning sultry vocals from Bernd, who's gunning for the ladies attention with lines like `I can't live without your kisses, your spirit and your soul' - commence swoon, girls! Some great dirty bluesy electric guitar as well, but it's bass player Horst that really steals the piece and makes it his own, just dominating the entire track. Especially listen to his grumbling bass soloing in the middle!

   The hard R&amp;B of `The Work Is Done' from Birth Control's terrific `Operation' album has been given a slight disco tweak here, although it's still quite heavy with wailing guitar soloing and shimmering organ. Admittedly this shorter version lacks the pleading lyric and somber atmosphere of the original, but still shows what a great tune it is anyway.

   OK, so perhaps the album is a little dated by the endless funky bass playing (as terrific as it is), but there's no denying the talent still on display with the band. On `Live '79' you have a first-rate rock band playing in a more approachable melodic rock style while still incorporating progressive rock sophistication throughout. Well worth three and a half stars to my ears.

   Why not dig out a copy for your next long drive on a nice summer day, I guarantee you'll have a great time!
