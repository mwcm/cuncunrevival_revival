   Formed in 1968 by Abe and Ivory Tillman and James Mitchell, they were actually dropped from Ric Tic after Motown bought out the label and let the band go! Their sound heavily influenced by the mid-60s Motown sound (which is perhaps why that label showed so little interest) kept them in the charts throughout the early '70s. They eventually moved to Atlantic where they recut 'Feel The Need In Me', the new version reaching No 12 in the UK in 1977, and the album "Let's Get Together". Now firmly ensconced on the international cabaret circuit, the band's original hits are more popular than ever in the clubs and through cover versions. A classy slice of early '70s, smooth-harmonied soul.

   Good album, but such a high score because it contains one of the greatest soul-funk groovers there is "Baby Let Me Take You (In My Arms)".  I know it's worth owning for that song alone, but to top that it also contains "Feel The Need In Me".  As if that wasn't enough, it also has a great cover, very of it's day.
