   Curiously, 1973's "Farewell To Paradise" tends to get written off by the critics and was largely ignored by radio and the buying public.  That's unfortunate since to my ears it's every bit as good as his earlier work.  In fact, I'd argue it's even more impressive given it was written and recorded while under intense personal and professional pressure from his record label (I wonder if that had anything to do with the album title).  Looking at the results strictly on technical terms the album's amazing, standing as a true example of one man virtuosity - Rhodes wrote all of the material, produced, arranged and played all of the instruments.  The first set to be recorded in a professional studio (remember most of his earlier work had been recoded in a home studio located in this mother's garage), this time around the album sported a much cleaner sound.  Tracks such as 'Warm Self Sacrifice', 'See No Evil' and 'Only Lovers Decide' (the latter being one of his prettiest ballads), aptly displayed Rhodes' endearing strengths; highly commercial melodies, mesmerizing harmonies and an endearing sense of enthusiasm for the music.  At the same time, on songs like 'Blue Horizon' many of the lyrics seemed to betray a growing sense of sadness and resignation.  Virtually every one of the twelve tracks would have made a dandy single making it hard to pick the standout tracks.  Personal favorites include 'Drawn To You', the country-influence 'Blue Horizon' and the funky 'Shoot the Moon'.

   "Farewell to Paradise" from 1973 was Emitt Rhodes fourth and so far his last album. After two great albums his third, "Mirror", was somewhat disappointing, containing only a couple of memorable songs.

   "Farewell to Paradise" doesn't match his two first albums either, but it does contain some great songs.

   The great ballad "Only Lovers Decide" is as strong as anything on the first two albums, and the title-track "Farewell to Paradise" is gradually becoming one of my favourite Emitt Rhodes songs.

   I guess, you can say that "Farewell to Paradise" is Rhodes' most personal album and the least Beatles influenced. I'm not very keen on his music when he turns too much towards jazz, which he does on a few songs on this album. A song like "Blue Horizon" which does not sound much like anything he's recorded earlier, is one of the greatest on this album - one the most country-influenced songs he's recorded. The quiet acoustic "Trust No More" is a nice song that is very likely to grow on you.

   Unfortunately most of the other songs are relatively forgettable and thus the album as such is no more than decent. Some versions of the album include the fine single "Time the Lion" - a comment to America's war in Vietnam. The song really ought have been included in the first place.

   While it's true that he never duplicated the consistency of his 1970 masterpiece "Emitt Rhodes" (being sued by your own record comapny while you're working on your new album will have that effect!), Farewell to Paradise contains some of the most beautiful songs Emitt Rhodes ever recorded. The title track which ends the album is as near perfection as you'll find in pop/rock - gorgeous guitar hook, soaring verse &amp; chorus, perfect middle 8, with his as-usual stunning bass &amp; percussion. There are a number of tracks on this record which fall far below the standard he set with his best work - some are downright maudlin - but Warm Self Sacrifice, Blue Horizon, Trust Once More, and Only Lovers Decide, along with the title track, make this an essential album. Do the world a favor - pass the word about the incomparable Emitt Rhodes: his songwriting, sweet &amp; soulful singing, masterful musicianship, and amazing production make him as rare in the world of recorded music as a .400 hitter in baseball.
