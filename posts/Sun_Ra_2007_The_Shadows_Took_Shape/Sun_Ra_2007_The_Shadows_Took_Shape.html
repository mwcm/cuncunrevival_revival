   This recording is from a concert during the early 1970's. There is no further information on this recording, except that the original reel tape was labeled as "Spacemaster Concert". June Tyson recites "The Shadows Took Shape", a Sun Ra poem never heard or seen until now.

   The LOST REEL series of previously unreleased Sun Ra recordings, mostly recorded in the 1970s in California, are like manna from heaven for Ra mavens. THE SHADOWS TOOK SHAPE, the third volume in the series, was discovered in a tape can simply labeled "Spacemaster Concert," and it lives up to that interstellar title. Like much of Sun Ra's best work, it mixes Ellington-on-acid jazz orchestrations with mindblowing layers of freer-than-free sonic exploration spiced with touches of cosmic exotica.

   The third volume in the Lost Reel Collection is one mysterious recording from the vast vault of Sun Ra; the performance was found on a tape with the title, Spacemaster Concert. It was recorded on an undetermined date in the early-1970s and has a metallic quality due to Sun Ra's electric keyboards, which retains an free jazz quality, though the tones are much noisier.

   The vocals of June Tyson are impeccable, with the standout selections being Exotic Forest, Shadow World and Friendly Galaxy/Watusi. There remains a number of questions surrounding the recording that may never be solved. This is truly something out of lost-and-found, with the waiting being the hardest part.
