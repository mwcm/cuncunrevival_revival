     During the late 60's, Bobby Callender was one of the most mythical figures in popular music. Conceptually his musical universe delivers all the originality of an artistic freedom, really awakened of alternative lifestyle, cross cultures and psychedelic "civilization". Callender is an afro American who turned to mystic and reaches himself into Indian raga, philosophies from the East. The two albums he recorded under his name ("Rainbow" in 1968, "The Way" in 1971) are currently seen as the two logical sides of a grandiloquent project including numerous musicians from the jazz and raga scenes. Among the featured musicians we can quote the famous "India raga style" guitarist Collin Walcott. Bobby Callender composes almost all titles and make some recitations. "Rainbow" released in 1968 is a fantastic effort, really amazing, played freely with numerous dialogues between sitar and tabla, with subtle adds of violin, piano and bass (electric). The main elements of composition are the rhythm, very structured, complex and the improvisational jazz / "raga" which introduces us in a spiritual and floating psychedelic atmosphere. The two albums are really conceptual, developing short, esoteric tales mostly served by basic themes of eastern instrumentations and odd, spoken words. Bobby Callender's musical signature is a perfect illustration of free form "ethnic" jazz improvisations in adequacy with the growing effervescence of the 60's "acid", psychedelic philosophies.

     A very colourful, personal and polyphonic album by this curious American jazz rock artist. The main objective pursued is to create a ravishing mental journey through ragas and different jazz like improvisations. Bobby Callender easily used the traditional instruments of eastern classical music for circular motifs (but without turning minimalist or obsessional) and combines this force with groovy &amp; jazzy experimentations. The title track is a brief western raga featuring floating sitar lines, echoing manipulated voices (which provide an "acid" temper) and orchestral arrangements. The atmosphere is very "kitsch" and romantic but definitely curious. "Nature" is an impressive psychedelic raga rock composition with "stoned" vocals, electric guitar sections and usual eastern ingredients. "Sade Masoch" includes a jazz part for trombone mixed to a dancing sitar / voice duet. "Purple" is closed to new age (before time); a long flowing, ethereal composition with easy effects and charming sounds taken from the elements. "Mother Superior» is a melodramatic ballad for orchestra. "Autumn" is a track for piano and violin which covers different kind of "world" jazz and popular music. "Man" is a sleeping pop jazz ballad which meets a hippie-like background. This album is not a milestone in jazz indo fusion for the reason that it sometimes turns "raga" into an object of "common" meditation and mainstream ballad...abandoning the goal of trancey state and visceral, emotional effervescences. However it's a nice addition for fans of "world" music and fusion jazz.

     This bizarre, Alan Lorber-produced psychedelic album appeared originally in 1969 on Boston Sound. Bobby Callendar was an incredibly gifted poet and lyricist whose complex texts could only be compared to Scott Walker; the concepts of a U.K. artist of Indian heritage post-psychedelia were augmented by the lush arrangements of Paul Harris and Bob Gallo. The cast of musicians on this album included some of the highest-caliber sidemen of the time, most notably Richard Davis, the master bassist of Van Morrison's Astral weeks fame (not to mention a jazz musician in his own right), the guitars of Eric Gale and Hugh McCracken, and the astonishingly subtle Burnard Purdie on drums. The album is a rich and complex exploration of Eastern-inspired psychedelic rock and folk centered on the incredibly complex texts and vocals of Bobby Callendar. When reading the lyric sheet, it is most astonishing how such elaborate poetic evocations were somehow made to fit popular song forms. Sure, at these highly conscious times of the late '60s it was not uncommon for deeply poetic, socially conscious, or hallucinogenic themes to appear in the lyrics of pop music, yet this is album is absolutely brilliant for being one of the most ostentatious animations of the written word, yet absolutely vital and musical throughout. Fans of Scott Walker's solo material, Colin Blundstone, and Duncan Browne should give this album a few hours -- if not a week -- of their attention. This excellent Italian reissue from Akarma is packaged and remastered exquisitely.
