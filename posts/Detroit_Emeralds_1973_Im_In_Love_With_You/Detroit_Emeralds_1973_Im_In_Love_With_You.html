   The year 1973 turned out to be prolific for the Detroit Emeralds, who released not one but two of what many would consider to be their finest albums since their days on the Ric-Tic imprint during the heydays of Motown.

   Although the label Westbound Records was known primarily for the early catalog of Funkadelic and The Ohio Players, one of their most underrated acts came in the form of the trio The Detroit Emeralds. While they seemed like they could have been Michigan natives, in reality, they were from Little Rock, Arkansas. The trio initially started out as a quintet with the Tillmon brothers: Raymond, Cleophus, Ivory and primary songwriter and producer Abram. They recorded a few minor hits, but were downsized to a trio by the turn of the 1970's- with lead singer James Mitchell taking the place of Raymond and Cleophus. Things were looking up for the band when they were signed to Westbound. In 1971, they released their formal debut "Do Me Right", followed by 1972's "You Want It, You Got It". However, their most sought after recording also happens to be their most rare: 1973's "I'm In Love With You"- an album that later became known for having one of the most popular breakbeat used in hip hop and R&amp;B, "You're Getting A Little Too Smart". Despite the album being raided for samples by the likes of Masta Ace, Raekwon, Main Source and J Dilla, there are several great songs on here that are worthy of attention.

   They start off the album with the approval seeking "Shake Your Head", while bringing in the six minute breakup lament "So Long". Also included is "You're Getting A Little Too Smart", followed by the eight minute medley "Think Of You/You Control Me". They question their significant other's mood swings on "Whatcha Gonna Wear Tomorrow". They bring in another medley: This time around, it consists of three songs- "Heaven Couldn't Be like This", "Without You Baby" and the title track "I'm In Love With You". Lastly, they close the album out with the brief uptempo "My Dreams Have Got The Best Of Me".
