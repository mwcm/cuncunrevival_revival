   There’s a knowing shrug to the title of Time for Another, Ace’s second album, an admission that this is just another round, not dissimilar to another pint of bitter served up halfway into a leisurely evening at the pub. Despite several shared traits, Time for Another is distinctly different than the casually funky Five-A-Side, extending the cool, soft groove of “How Long” throughout an entire LP. There’s a bit of boogie and twang, apparent in the relaxed shuffle of “I’m a Man,” the muted rocking of “You Can’t Lose,” and the lazy blues of “Ain’t Gonna Stand for This No More.” By and large, though, Time for Another is a very easy-rolling affair -- too easy, in fact, sounding too comfortable in its hazy surroundings, sometimes slipping into the sleepiness a third or fourth beer can lend.

   Ace's unassuming bar-room boogie may not be to most people's taste but for me the only disappointment about this album is the inclusion of a loose, sloppy version of "Ain't Gonna Stand For This No More" rather than the excellent single version. Otherwise, this is a superb set of songs played and sung with heart and soul and expertly captured on tape by producer John Anthony.
