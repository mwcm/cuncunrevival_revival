  Somewhat amateur but inspired and energetic. Definitely lacking in cohesion in some parts (the first track for example). Jazzy soul/funk tinted Krautrock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where the Wild Things Are", "Simple Headphone Mind and the title track are the best songs IMO, with the former being the real standout for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was disappointed when I discovered that the mellow jazz parts of "Simple Headphone Mind" are copies of the beginning of Nucleus'"Torrid Zone" off of 'Elastic Rock.' Its a really nice chill jazz theme though and they do play it better here than Nucleus, with flute and a lot more soul and feel and without the fancy jazz (so it really sets and maintains a mood). Between those sections (3 of them) they launch (twice) into a loose, antsy, discordant free-style guitar-led jive for a total departure. Very schizophrenic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your Chance of a Lifetime" is a bit dull and suffers from poor vocals, too much reverb, lackluster instrumentation, guitar that is too loud and doesn't integrate with the music well in its tone or style, and finally an energetic and pointless jazz workout that is a complete nonsequiter to the song before it (as in "Simple Headphone Mind"). It feels like an imitation of some old minimalist blues. It has potential, it just falls a bit flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where The Wild Things Are" is where it all comes together and we get something that feels fluid, integrated, and more inspired/original. It is more of a jam, that transitions in very smooth and integrated ways as opposed to the jarring non-sequiter transitions of the first songs. It grooves, especially at the song's end (!) It is a shame that this song is the shortest of the album and the rest of this album is not more like it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The title track, "Vampire State Building" that starts with a jazz-rock groove and features a pretty cool 9/8 jazzy drum groove and bass grooves toward the beginning. It is a very fragmentary "song" that then goes into a  weird dinky section and ends with some appropriated soul blues
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The free jam of "Piss Off" is designed to do just that, though it is somewhat interesting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall a very inconsistent, schizophrenic, ADD Kraut/jazz/rock/soul/blues album that also suffers from an uncertain musical identity. that is generally good with some high points and some sloppiness.
