   Gibbs second album continues from where his debut left off but introduces some pieces that stretch into new territory. Tanglewood, the opening number, is a good example of his usual style, the language is jazz but the composition a little different. There’s a Carribean flavour to it,  although, ultimately, an African one, I suppose. Born in Zimbabwe, music college in The States and recording in England with some of its finest jazz musicians, what would you expect? The drums tend towards a rock style, the phrasing is jazz but the results have a refreshing third-world quality. Fanfare, for instance, could have been performed by some marching band from the colonies and Sojourn, continuing in a similar vein, is a mood piece that has little to do with jazz and is evocative of lazy, hot summer days under a tropical sun... riding an elephant even! This is not toe-tapping swing, Gibbs hybrids are quite unique, although Ellington’s mood pieces may have been a point of departure.

   What would have been side two of the album contains two lengthy pieces that move even further away from standard jazz-rock. Canticle is an abstract soundscape, the equivalent of a Jackson Pollack being created in real time, that, once again, evokes an hallucinatory mid-afternoon doze where even the animals find it too hot to function. Its gossamer thin arrangement drifts across one’s consciousness  like an eerie lullaby. It sounds improvised but I’ll bet Gibbs had it all written out.

   In contrast, Five For England is full of vitality and features Chris Spedding’s choppy guitar. Much as I like his playing, his sense of timing sometimes drags behind the jazz-rock drive in a way that bothers me, I much prefer his wah-wah and tremolo licks. This last piece seems a little more improvisational compared to the meticulous arrangements on side one, it also steers a course back towards the main-stream -  more r&amp;b than jazz though - and a long, long way from where the previous piece had brought us to, making this album a wonderfully varied listening experience.

   Available on a double CD,  Michael Gibbs first two albums seem sadly overlooked but should appeal to anyone interested in British jazz or jazz-fusion of the time.

   Michael Gibbs/Tanglewood '63 assembles arranger Michael Gibbs classic LPs for the Deram label. If Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band had actually existed -- a sprawling, Nehru-jacketed psychedelic orchestra come to life -- their music would have undoubtedly sounded exactly like Gibbs' self-titled Deram debut. Recorded with British crossover titans including guitarist Chris Spedding, trumpeter Kenny Wheeler and electric pianist Gordon Beck, the album was a seminal turning point in the history of U.K. jazz-rock, embracing avant-garde-inspired brass passages, electrifying guitar solos, and thunderous yet funky rhythms to create music entirely of its time but distinctly out of time as well. And for all its post-Hendrix sound and spirit, Michael Gibbs still retains the soulfulness of conventional jazz -- the music speaks to the body as loudly as it does the intellect. Tanglewood '63 is even better, vividly majestic music of remarkable scope and energy -- Gibbs' ingenious arrangements suggest a pop-art incarnation of a traditional big band. Assembled from blistering guitar riffage, fiery brass and deeply idiosyncratic rhythms, Tanglewood '63 is most impressive for the tactile sumptuousness of Gibbs' sound -- the music boasts as many tints and textures as a Pantone Color Guide.
