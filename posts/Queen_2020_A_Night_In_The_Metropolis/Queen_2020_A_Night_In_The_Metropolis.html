   This is the first show of Queen's second tour of Japan. The band arrived a couple days earlier, and the next day they did a press conference followed by a reception held by Elektra Records.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie is in great voice tonight, but it is a bit of a difficult night for Brian. First, he breaks a string in the first chorus of White Queen, and has to struggle through the next verse of the song before he take a quick break to switch to a spare guitar for the solo. Later he has a tough time getting into the guitar solo in Bohemian Rhapsody, perhaps out of nerves for performing their biggest hit in Japan for the first time. He does, however, offer some nifty guitar work in the coda of Doing All Right.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian, after White Queen: "Thank you, it's good to back. It's been too long. We've been away too long. You might remember this one from Sheer Heart Attack. This is Flick Of The Wrist."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after the medley: "I hope you're all having a good time! I bet you are. If I could do it in Japanese I could say, right now we'd like to feature Brian May on the guitar." The audience responds very enthuasiastically nonetheless. "This is a song that we didn't do last time, but we're gonna do it now. A song called Brighton Rock."

   Freddie has rested his voice after the Osaka gigs, and delivers a much more solid performance. His voice would remain strong for the rest of the Japanese tour.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after the medley: "Now, then, my little cuties. It's now time to feature Brian May on the guitar. Old curly over there. And this is a song, I think we did it, yes, we did it when we were here last, a couple of weeks ago. It's the same old song, so get on your feet and do something. Brighton Rock!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after a blistering Doing All Right: "Arigato. Arigato very much. Now then, let's have some hanky panky, eh? This is called Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tonight's appearance of Seven Seas Of Rhye is a nice surprise on this tour (with gorgeous vocal harmonies in the bridge), along with the rare encore of See What A Fool I've Been. Before Roger speaks to introduce Seven Seas Of Rhye, a cheeky Mercury introduces him. "Our brilliant Roger," he says from the piano.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This would be the final performance of Seven Seas Of Rhye for many years. It would be revived for the Works and Magic tours as an abbreviated version, always part of a medley.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   One of the audience recordings of the show provides some insight into one of the intricacies of the show. Since it was taped from far off on stage left, the stage right speakers aren't audible. At the end of Liar, when Roger is doing his cymbal swirls, they disappear and then return, indicating that they are being panned from left to right by the front of house guy, Jonathan Harris - a detail surely missed by most but appreciated by the few.

   Freddie, after greeting the audience in Japanese: "Ok, it's nice to know you're doing fine. I'm sure that was what you said. It's really nice to be back here for the third show in Tokyo [with March 22 being the first], so let's have some fun, right? This is a song called Sweet Lady." Mercury almost goes into the first chorus a bit early, but he recovers well.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is an excellent performance by the band. The backing vocals are absolutely spot on tonight, particularly in Flick Of The Wrist.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, afterward: "That song was about a very nasty man. Now we're gonna do a song about two nasty men, about two murderers. A song that we did last year when we were here in Nippon, in Japan. It's a song called Hangman." This is the last known live airing of the non-album track.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, before Brighton Rock: "Okay, all you cheeky things, we're now gonna feature Brian May on the guitar. Yes, and to feature him this is a song called Brighton Rock."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after Stone Cold Crazy: "Are you having fun? Are you having a good time? Yes, I'm sure you are. If only I could speak a little bit more Japanese." He then begins to introduce a song that hasn't been played in nearly a year.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Right now we'd like to a number that we haven't done for a long, long time. This is a song called Father To Son." Unlike versions from 1973-75, Freddie actually plays the intro on the piano (too fast, actually, and the band gradually slow it down before the vocal enters), instead of having the album version on playback as they had done before. This and the following night are the only two known instances of the song performed this way. At the end of the song, Freddie happily says (possibly referring to some rehearsal during soundcheck): "Yeah, we finally got that together!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie's piano intro to In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited includes the part he'd play in I'm In Love With My Car on later tours.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The extra drawn out ending of See What A Fool I've Been heard tonight is very effective in ending a concert.

   his is the final show of Queen's second tour of Japan. The Sendai show was intended to be the last night, but this show in Tokyo was added due to ticket demand. The Budokan presumably wasn't available, so another venue was found.

   In the spring of 1975 Queen set foot as a band for the first time in Japan much to the delight of their legions of fans there. The band played their first of many gigs at Budokan after the release of 1974’s Sheer Heart Attack and the footage from the show is truly something to behold as are the images of the then 29-year-old Mercury sitting along with his bandmates and a few lovely geishas at a formal ceremony on the grass in front of the Tokyo Tower.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Queen would return the very next year to Tokyo in support of their 1976 album A Day at the Races and were photographed hanging out with Sumo wrestlers, drinking sake and greeting a group of fascinated Japanese children who likely had no idea what to make of Freddie Mercury dressed in a multi-colored knit coat sporting long hair and dark sunglasses. The photos are as charming as they are gorgeous to look at. I’ve also included fantastic footage from Queen’s very first press conference in Tokyo (that includes lots of other footage such as their arrival at the airport and the ceremony in front of the Tokyo Tower) as well as a stellar performance of the single from Sheer Heart Attack “Now I’m Here” from the band’s debut show at Budokan that is going to blow your socks off.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Queen’s inaugural performance at Budokan was of course bootlegged and can be tracked down on various Internet sites but as a huge fan I remain hopeful that the performance will get a proper official release as did Queen’s legendary show at the Odeon in London on Christmas Eve in 1975 Queen- A Night At the Odeon (which just so happens to include a bit of footage from Queen’s Budokan gig—three songs specifically “Now I’m Here,” “Killer Queen,” and “In The Lap Of The Gods… Revisited”).

  Well, since anything worth doing, is also worth overdoing, and that has been sort of out moto in the past, I dug deep in the external files and found the rest of the recordings of the Japanese 1976 tour. I hope you guys and girls have a great time with all these shows, 1976 is my favorite period of the band live, so I personally can't get enough from all these recordings.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite a strong start to the show, Freddie's voice is a bit rough in a few spots throughout.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after Flick Of The Wrist: "And now we're gonna do a medley of four songs from four of our different albums, and we're gonna start with a number, I think you know this one, it's called Bohemian Rhapsody." Technically he wasn't right about that, as no songs from the first album were part of the medley.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After the medley: "It's time we featured Brian May on the guitar. Yes, I think you're gonna like this. This is a song that we didn't do last time but we're gonna do it for you right now. It's a number called Brighton Rock."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After he does his usual toast to the audience, Freddie adds, "May you all drink champagne tomorrow for breakfast." He goes on, "Right now we'd like to do a number," but his attention is then diverted. "Oh, you understood that one. Cheeky little thing!" he says to someone close to the stage, as he knows how rare it is for a Japanese audience member to be fluent in English. He then says how he wishes he could speak more Japanese after he asks them for song requests from their debut album and gets none! They then play Doing All Right as usual, during which Brian has much fun in the coda with his delay.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the a cappella vocal section of The Prophet's Song, Freddie references Death On Two Legs as he often would during this era. While he would usually only sing the lyrics "Death on two legs, you're tearing me apart" this year, tonight he adds "kill joy, bad guy." He and Roger harmonize beautifully throughout the song.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As Roger plays the drum intro to Liar, Freddie says, "C'mon, blondie!"

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Roger Taylor's day at the office gets off to a tough start, as he flubs a couple backing vocals in Ogre Battle.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian, after White Queen: "We'd like to continue with a particularly vicious song by Freddie Mercury. This is Flick Of The Wrist."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie isn't in his strongest voice early in the Japanese tour, but the end of Bohemian Rhapsody is gorgeous tonight.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian plays his Bring Back That Leroy Brown banjo solo in the wrong key - the only time he'd mess this bit up in the song's three years on stage. He soon makes up for it by offering a very tasteful Brighton Rock solo with many musically wonderful moments.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie's middle section of The Prophet's Song is excellent tonight. Even with his limited vocal range, he manages to craft some very interesting vocal lines.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For the first verse of Doing All Right, Freddie uses his voice to the best of his ability to give a unique delivery of the debut album song. Afterward, "This is one minute six seconds of a song called Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon," followed by a huge roar from the audience.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian May is on fire in the improv section of Liar.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie is a bit disoriented in In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited. He sings the first verse again in place of the second verse, and treats the second chorus like the first, singing "I can see what you want me to be" instead of continuing with the "Wo wo la la la" part, but he quickly corrects himself. But he was aware that it was the second chorus, because just before it he notes, "Here it comes again," possibly suggesting he isn't particularly looking forward to the chorus, as it is a challenge for him when his voice isn't in its best shape.

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Queen play two shows today, and this listing highlights the evening show.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It's a pretty rough night for Freddie, as the two-show day leaves his voice sounding pretty strained.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie speaks to the audience in Japanese after Sweet Lady, a moment which always receives a cheer wherever they play in the country. He says to himself, "Ah, I love how that works." Great versions of White Queen and Flick Of The Wrist follow. Brian introduces the latter as "a dirty little number."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie: "We'd like to do a medley for you, about four songs from.. I think you've heard most of these before, except for the first one, and it's gonna be a slightly different version. Anyway, this is a song.. we're gonna start off with a song called Bohemian Rhapsody."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie, after Son And Daughter: "Now, let's have some more fun, eh? We're going to do a new number from our album A Night At The Opera. That's the album, which you've all got by now, and this is a song that's written by Brian May. It took about six minutes I think, or nine minutes, a song called... a number called The Prophet's Song." He corrects himself, as he feels the formal classification of "number" is more appropriate for this epic piece of work.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After Stone Cold Crazy, he says, "Ahh, they're all sitting down. They must know what's coming next." He drinks his usual champagne toast to the audience with "Kampai!" which is cheers in Japanese. He adds, "That's the one that gets them every time." He then introduces Doing All Right. Freddie is careful with the higher notes, but he still delivers the song very effectively. Their vocal harmonies are exquisite.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie nails the piano intro to Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon, although Brian messes up the solo at the end of the short song. Both Freddie and Roger are audibly amused.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Roger Taylor's drum solo in Keep Yourself Alive is simply manic.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian: "From Liar to something which was on Sheer Heart Attack. Something very near the end, as this is. This is In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited. Thanks a lot."

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Queen play two shows today (notably the last time they would have a two-show day). This is the early show, at 2pm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After a couple days' rest, Mercury sounds pretty strong overall.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A Night At The Opera was (not so arguably) Queen's creative peak, and this ensuing tour may have seen them at their musical best on stage. Their vocal harmonies particularly stand out this afternoon. Ogre Battle, Sweet Lady and Now I'm Here are flawlessly executed, both musically and vocally.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian speaks after Liar: "To finish off, we'd like to do something from Sheer Heart Attack. Thank you for being really nice. This has been a good afternoon performance, I think. Ok, this is In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band omit Big Spender, effectively combining Now I'm Here and Jailhouse Rock into a single encore. Perhaps they always did this on double show days, as the same thing happened in Manchester last year. Freddie throws a verse of Jerry Lee Lewis' Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On into Jailhouse Rock.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Freddie's voice isn't in the greatest shape tonight, after having already sung the afternoon show followed by a party between the gigs. He forgets a few words in the first verse of Bohemian Rhapsody, and barely manages to mumble his way through it. But he settles down by The Prophet's Song, where he throws a bit of Frère Jacques into the a cappella section, much to the delight of the audience. The vocal harmonies in the song sound great.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian has some tuning problems a few minutes into his solo spot in Brighton Rock, but he does manage to fix it up (with the added bonus of having the delay on). Later, he crafts some very nifty sounds in the Stone Cold Crazy solo.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The ever-underrated John Deacon's bass work is brilliant in Flick Of The Wrist and Doing All Right.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band have a bit of trouble getting into the first verse of Keep Yourself Alive. A few bars after they fall apart, Freddie cues everyone together by shouting, "Now!"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Brian, near the end of the set: "Thank you for being a really nice audience. We'd like to finish up with something from Sheer Heart Attack. This is a song by Freddie, who'll be tinkling ivories. This is In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisited."
