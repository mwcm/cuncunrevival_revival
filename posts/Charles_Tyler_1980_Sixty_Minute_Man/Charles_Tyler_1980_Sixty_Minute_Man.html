   Charles Tyler spent the mid-'60s playing for the legendary Albert Ayler, with whom he shares his burly tone and wide vibrato. Tyler's 1980 LP Sixty Minute Man is a reasonably successful attempt to make his gutsy, blues-soaked belting work in a solo setting. It isn't nearly as fiery and invigorating as his work with Ayler, but that has more to do with the fact that there are fewer musicians to load the mix with ideas than with any major deficiency in Tyler's playing. He's at his best on the lengthy opening cut, "The Mid-Western Drifter," which begins with moving, lugubrious alto sax lines and becomes more frenzied as the piece progresses. The second half of the album sags a bit when Tyler switches instruments: He's best known for playing baritone, and he pulls off some pleasantly hypnotic circular breathing tricks near the end of "A Tale of Bari Red," but the piece mostly proves that his ideas didn't flow as freely on baritone as they did on alto. Still, the bulk of this release is exciting enough if you aren't expecting an Ayler-esque blowout; Sixty Minute Man may be more resigned than most free jazz, but it's nice to hear Tyler's rich, heavy tone in a more intimate setting.
