  This is one of those records that makes you wish you've never rated music. On one hand it's really very chaotic as you can never actually hear the instruments separately - all you hear is the sum of their sounds so it seems that all the guys play is merely noise. But on the other hand I can't get rid of the feeling that there is just too much sound on the album (especially on the first track) - maybe if they gave each other just a little bit more space we could really appreciate their unique ways of dealing with the sound, or maybe this chaotic sound is the main idea - like Ornette's Skies of America (which is, somehow, much easier to appreciate). So I give this album four stars merely because it gives a lot to think about - probably, I will be never able to say whether I like it or not. Anyway, those people, who say that the record "makes no sense" completely miss the point - there is no "sense" in music, that's why we love it so much.
