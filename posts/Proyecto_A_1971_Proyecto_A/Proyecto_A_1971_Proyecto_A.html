   Proyecto A was the brainchild of the great Frank Dubé from Barcelona. What can we say about him? A truly fascinating character: a pioneer of rock &amp; roll and twist in Spain during the late 50s and early 60s, an accomplished accordion player, a showman, comedian, a Psychoaesthetics master…But he should also be considered as one of the first psychedelic pioneers in Spain due to his groundbreaking work on the Proyecto A album.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Frank started working on Proyecto A in 1969. Impressed by the moon landing, he wanted to create a concept album about the Solar System planets using tone scales and groove music so people could dance to it at clubs. He recruited some of the best studio musicians around and the result was delirious concept album fuelled by fuzz-wah guitars, powerful, crazy vocals, electronic &amp; bizarre effects, Hammond organ, soulish horns, funky drums…

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Due to the limitations of recording studios in Spain at the time, Frank had to create his own effects and sound effects for the album. He used a primitive Binson Echo unit, he recorded vocals through guitar amps, he used guitar effects on the keyboards, recorded with a portable microphone the sound of the beach, waves and TV sounds…

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Proyecto A was released in 1971 housed in an amazing gatefold sleeve depicting all the musicians wearing strange &amp; bizarre psychedelic outfits. The project was shrouded in mystery (Frank used pseudonyms for all the musicians involved) and for many years the Proyecto A album has been plagued with many false rumors and stories. We set the record straight with this, the first ever reissue done in cooperation with Frank Dubé.

   This will surprise anyone into Latin-Funk-Psych and Library / Cinematic sounds. Lots of killer flute, drumbreaks, Hammond, Fender Rhodes, electric guitar…Including tracks like the cosmic “Missatge espaial d’amor”, conceived by Frank as the soundtrack to the first sexual intercourse in space.

   Josep "Kitflus" Mas' (ex-Iceberg, ex-Pegasus and usual contributor of Joan Manuel Serrat, among many others) first band. The band broke up after releasing this only album. He was 16 then. The following information has been provided by courtesy of Electrofuzzer of Sonidos En Órbita: "PROYECTO "a" is an album masterminded by Frank David, aka Frank Dubé. The names of the musicians involved are unknown (apart from Kitflus), since they all used pseudonyms. The album was recorded at the RCA studios un Madrid, yet most of the session musicians hailed from Barcelona. It was recorded in '69 and released one year later; in 1971 the single "A Plutón" (To Pluton) was released with alternative lyrics, replacing the word "Plutón" (Pluton) with "Putón" (whore or slut). In 1971 Frank David goes to Germany to make an electronic album called Blues And Electronics under the "The Frank David Selection" monniker, with Herb Geller and Okko Becker (of OKKO Sitar &amp; Electronics fame) on the moog. The album was released on the defunct BASF label.
