   Simply said, Emitt Rhodes'"The American Dream" has the distinction of being the best 'contractual obligation' album you'll ever have the pleasure of hearing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As you'd expect, the album has a rather tortuous history.  When the Merry-Go-Round collapsed in 1969, under their recording contract they still owed their label A&amp;M Records another album.  As de facto band leader, it was left up to singer/songwriter/guitarist Rhodes to go back into the studio in an effort to cobble together a second album.  The end result consisted of a mix of previously completed Merry-Go-Round tracks, polished up demos and some new studio tracks.  Rhodes completed the project in mid-1969, but A&amp;M management simply shelved the project.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Jump ahead and 1970 saw Rhodes solo career beginning to attract  considerable attention via his self-titled 1970 ABC/Dunhill debut.  More than willing to cash-in on Rhodes sudden commercial recognition, A&amp;M wasted no time dusting off the earlier material.  Packaged as an Emitt Rhodes solo effort, the album had the misfortune of being released at the same time Rhodes' second Dunhill album hit the streets.

   In spite of the fact it was a product of corporate indifference and greed, the album was simply great.  Easily as good as Rhodes' first two Dunhill solo effort, the collection effortlessly showcased Rhodes' knack for penning highly commercial, radio-friendly pop.  Tracks such as 'Mother Earth', ' Pardon Me', 'Holly Park' and 'In Days of Old' were full of Beatles influences (or at least McCartney influences), but in a good way ...  as opposed to being the product of a slavish imitator.  The album's also impressive for simply sounding so go.  Rhodes may have stitched the results together,  but you're hard pressed to tell.  Merry-Go-Round demos such as 'You're a Very Lonely Woman', 'Come Ride, Come Ride' and ''Till the Day After' sound right at home with his new studio material.  Elsewhere, A&amp;M tapped 'You're a Very Lonely Woman' b/w ''Til the Day After' as a single (A&amp;M catalog number 1254).  That drew the ire of former members of Merry-Go-Round who apparently muttered lawsuit under their collective breathes leading concerned A&amp;M executives to stand their ground (ha) reissuing subsequent pressings of the LP without the song.  The company also elected to slap a new cover on subsequent releases (see below).  While hundreds of albums are labeled as 'lost classics', this one's truly deserving of that label.

   Much better in reality than it is in theory. What should sound like a stew of leftovers and demos ends up being a very listenable smorgasbord of delights. Perhaps it's most important aspect is it's stepping stone relation to Rhodes' trilogy of proper solo albums. It was Emitt working on finishing this project to fulfill the Merry-Go-Round A&amp;M contract and his lack of complete satisfaction with outside arrangements that led him to the conclusion that "if you want it done right, you've got to do it yourself". The album was released in two configurations, one with the previously released "You're A Very Lovely Woman" and the final release with "Saturday Night" in it's place. "Textile Factory" tends to attract some negative reaction, as does the calypso experiment of "Mary Will You Take My Hand", and both seem to take their cue from the White Album's "Don't Pass Me By" and "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" - which are the two tracks from that album that are probably it's weakest spots. However, do not miss "Holly Park", "Mother Earth", "Pardon Me" or "In Days Of Old" - all of which are very strong and very essential listening.
