  Apple is a rather typical British psychedelic-pop group of the late ’60s. Their sound is characterized by a blend of spiky guitar and piano, as well as accomplished harmonies. They were one of the few groups from the period that managed to release an album, it was the singles that this group produced that gained them their reputation and paved the way for their sole album.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An Apple A Day”, is a fine mixture of piano based psych pop / psychedelic and heavier R&amp;B / garage songs. Their first two 45s are included and these four tracks are among its finer moments. “The Otherside” truly bends the ear with with its wonderful sad melody and captivating piano-guitar arrangement. Another highlight is “Buffalo Billy Can” with its similar inventive guitar and piano figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The album was a commercial failure, and the band ceased to exist shortly after its release. However, during the subsequent years several of its tracks were dubbed classics of British psychedelic rock by critics, making “An Apple A Day” a famous album among the British psychedelic rarities.
