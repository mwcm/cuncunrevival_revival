   Right after defying the boundaries of idiom with his Hammond B-3 organ and big band collaborations with Lalo Schifrin (The Cat) and Oliver Nelson (Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?) in 1964, Jimmy Smith made his stark return to the organ trio format In 1965 with this strikingly fun-filled masterpiece that became another Top 20 album for him. Organ Grinder Swing is a highly acclaimed masterwork that found Smith in perfect companionship with the great jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell and session drummer Grady Tate as the three musicians gradually demonstrate a vibrant form of free spirited soul jazz and world class merriment, which produced both a true hit with the title track and the entire album as well. Beginning with the highly supercharged title track, the step by step track set proceeds at rapid pace on other organ classics, like the swooning Oh, No Babe and the classic Blues For J, as well as classic standards like Greensleeves, I’ll Close My Eyes and even Duke Ellington’s Satin Doll. Also a part of Verve’s Master Edition Series, what can be best described about Organ Grinder Swing are the liner notes that stated: “To many, the organ truly did belong in church, classical music, in movie palaces, or the roller rink--any place but jazz. In the end, it was listeners and fans who turned the tide--people for whom jazz was still a functioning social music”.

   Jimmy Smith was the Hammond organ soloist determined to help break with the instrument’s past by incorporating a set of modern mediums and yet found his way to create a new popular form of acceptance of the instrument, his ideas, a rich legacy, the countless jazz organists he influenced and for jazz itself.
