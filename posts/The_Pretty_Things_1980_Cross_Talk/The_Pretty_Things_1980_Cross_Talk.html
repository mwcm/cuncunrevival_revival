   Amazing. After two decades of influential but inconsistent work, The Pretty Things dropped everything and went head-first into power pop and new wave. I can imagine an unimpressed jaded listener saying that these guys just jumped on the bandwagon. But these guys made such a complete and radical change and did it so convincingly. For me, this album is 10-for-10 in potential hit songs....but unfortunately, it didn't happen (once again) for The Pretties.

   Although they had been responsible for some pretty radical and ambitious music in the past, they occasionally slipped into sloppiness. Not here though - they sound as if they were born to play this style. It's as if they were so familiar with the roots of the then-current bands that they were able to pull this off with a deeper understanding of the trend. And yet they manage to avoid the blander results of some of their polished but generic mid-'70's work as well. The band never sounded so tight and inspired - not a wasted note on the album. And the songs waste no time in achieving total catchiness and quirkiness - they are all airtight. It's a bit like the simplified, perfect collection that latter-day Utopia and Be-Bop Deluxe never quite achieved. Phil May's vocals are a complete departure and sound spot-on for the style. Although most of these songs are sweepingly summative of the era, he and the band go directly after The Police on the song "No Future" with a knowing smirk.

   For The Pretty Things to have accomplished this at this stage of their career (and they are still active!) is remarkable. The Kinks may have toyed with the idea at the time, but the Pretties absolutely mastered it. This exquisite collection of pop songs is one of the great lost albums for me.

   Who would have thought it? Reunited after splitting in the mid-'70s, the Pretty Things return with a new wave album. It's not what anyone might have expected, but it's very far from a disaster. The stop-on-a-dime arrangements and natural power show them to be well-seasoned, and Phil May, with an extremely mannered voice, comes across as a taunting frontman. In fact, you tend to feel that if Thin Lizzy had eased up on the metal, they might have made an album very much like this -- great, catchy songs based in R&amp;B and old rock &amp; roll ("Lost That Girl") -- but with the tongue firmly in cheek (check the Sting imitation on "No Future") while pandering to fashion. But when the results are as good as the jangly "Office Love" or "I'm Calling," you really don't care where the tongue's residing. There's a sense of history about the '50s drums on "Falling Again" that no young bucks could ever match, nor could they come close to the band's overall professionalism or stinging guitar work of Peter Tolson. Any of these ten tracks would have made a great single and by rights should have returned the band to major-name status. But justice is thin on the ground in music and instead it became one of the lost Pretties albums -- a shame, since in its own lighter way, it's every bit as good as their classic albums of a decade earlier. Some reunions don't work; this one just roars.
