   Chris Hinze is a jazz flute player born in the Netherlands in 1938. Studied at The Hague Royal Conservatory and in 1969 studied at Berklee Conservatory. In 1970, he participated in the Montreux Jazz Festival with his quartet and won the Soloist Award. He seems to have been active in a wide range of genres such as recording trilogy sessions with Japanese musical instrument players, such as jazz to baroque and shakuhachi Kuniyama Yamamoto in 1974, and later focusing on New Age.

   Recorded the first leader work in 1969. After releasing two albums in the quartet and one album in the name of the Chris Hinze combination (those are the three LP jackets on the back of the jacket), the fourth piece released in 1971 is this work.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The basics are quintets of flute, piano, guitar, bass, and drums, and four flutes participated in some songs. It's a fresh piece because it's not very familiar. It's a bit disappointing that there are no photos of the members. I don't know why it's on the jacket.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All eight songs recorded are Bacharach and David works.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Among them, B2. "Let Me Go To Him"​​and B3. "Paper Machete" are original by Dionne. Both songs were recorded on the 1970 album "I'LL NEVER FALL IN LOVE AGAIN," and both became single A-side songs, but they weren't covered much. The super rare "Let Me Go To Him"​​is the first cover version I've heard.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There are many relaxing arrangements throughout. I compared the tempo of each song with the original version of that song. Please see the radar chart. Most of the songs are slower than the original. In particular, A4. “A train, a ship, and an airplane” (♩≒72) and B3.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The original of B4. "Haruka no Kage" is Richard Chamberlain, but I compared it with the Carpenters here. The first A1. "April Fools" on the A side and the first B1. "Diss Guy" on the B side started with a simple and fantastic intro unlike any other cover, and I think this guy is not an ordinary person... I will. Throughout the entire volume, Chris plays melody using various techniques, such as flutter tongs and shakuhachi, which are not flashy, but are not flashy. This album isn't about easy listening, it's about jazz.

   I wrote that there are a lot of calm arrangements, but A2. "The world seeks love" and A3. "Koi no Omokage" have quite a lot of Chris and piano adlives, and the finish is hard. In particular, "Koi no Omokage" is an avant-garde adlive, and it has an impression that it is close to the world view of "Lupin the Third" TV series 1 (although it is my personal impression). This is my favorite in this album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There are some unfortunate songs like B4. "Haruka no Kage", which is monotonous without adoliv, but why wasn't it made into a CD so far? It was a bargain album that made me wonder. It's plain
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   By the way, when the remake of Wake Wana Jake was replaced in 1973 with a photo of Chris, the album name was also changed to "Hinze Plays Bacharach".

   Chris blows the flute in the jacket shot at the time of recurrence, and if you look closely, there are two tubes in parallel. Chris separates normal flute and alto flute depending on the song, but it sounds like a U-shaped alto flute. Since the alto flute is about 1.5 times as long as a normal flute and hard to reach, there are two types of shapes, straight and once bent U-shaped

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I don't know if that alto flute was the first time I learned this time , but according to the credit, Chris's flute is made of Muramatsu. I once read in a book that the first product that Japanese flutes received high praise in the US and Europe was Muramatsu flute, but I realized that it was already around 1970!?
