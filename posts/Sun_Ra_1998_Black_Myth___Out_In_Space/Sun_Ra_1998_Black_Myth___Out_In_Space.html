   Spectacular, wild double from two live 1970 dates in Germany. Black Myth, from Donaueschingen on October 17th, provides lots of up front horn madness throughout from the usual Gilmore-Allen-Patrick front line, augmented here by Danny Davis and Danny Thompson. But Sun Ra also turns in spectacular synthesizer solos (especially on the lead track), and June Tyson is by this time an indispensable part of the Arkestra. A difficult one for those who find freer music unpleasant listening, but a superb one for those prepared to meet the challenge. And after listening to the wonderful Black Myth I was shocked to find that Out in Space from two weeks later in Berlin, was even better. The opening title track, which goes on for nearly 40 minutes, is perhaps the best extended Sun Ra piece I've ever heard, starting at a fever pitch and never letting go for an instant. There are wild horn charts and solos, synth solos, even some beautiful acoustic piano (that of course edges up into something altogether more challenging), and much more throughout the length of the piece. It would seem that everything after would inevitably be anti-climactic, but it's never that easy with Ra. Next up there's some pieces from his "Discipline" series, then a great version of "Walking on the Moon," a couple more tracks and then another lengthy piece (15 minutes or so) called "Myth Versus Reality" that begins with a recitation and builds slowly into a typically wild and free number before the disc closes out with two signature chants. Both discs are excellently recorded and full of brilliant music, but they're not easy going.

   With nearly 165 minutes of music, the 2-CD set captures the incredible performance art of Sun Ra and the improvisational splendor of the Arkestra to make every concert a sonic experience, with a personal message.

   Released in December 1998, the first CD - Black Myth - is paced by Black Forest Myth and We'll Wait For You. Out In Space finds Sun Ra stretching themes within an avant-garde soundscape, as Myth Versus Reality and Theme of the Stargazers are pathways to Space Chants Medley and We Travel the Spaceways.

   The quenching of thirst through knowledge gained for the mind, body and soul are brought forth by the musical majesty of Sun Ra.
