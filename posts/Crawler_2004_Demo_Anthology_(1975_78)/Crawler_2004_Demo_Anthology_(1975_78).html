   This is an album of demos recorded between 1975 and 1978. This collection of songs, largely unfinished yet containing an essence of blues rock, highlights the greatness of the band that was unable to fully realize their potential during their time. Taken from unfinished songs ‘in the can’, “Demo Anthology” gives us more, not only of what we missed but also a glimpse into the song crafting process that Crawler employed.

   18 songs are on this album, filed in the year that the demo (song) was recorded. With this, we are afforded a rare view into the extraordinary output of Crawler as the band prepared to rehearse for their first and then their second release shortly thereafter.

   Selections include the demos for “Sail On” and “First Class Operator”, which were eventually finished and made it onto their second album. There are other songs that were demoed for the Snake sessions but didn’t make it onto the final product. You can call these gems extended jams because that is what they turned out to be. The importance of this album is that it gives up songs that would never be chosen (for the most part). It’s like getting another Crawler album. The stuff is unrefined but if you’re a fan, who cares.

   Listening to the early 75 -76 songs is pure Crawler output. These songs were good enough to be released and they rock. With the world much poorer for only 2 official Crawler releases at their time, albums like these help to fill the void.
