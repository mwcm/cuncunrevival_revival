   After Japanese Psych Rock legends Flower Travellin' Band disbanded in mid-70's, their guitarist Hideki Ishima went on to form this offshoot band with keyboardist Nobuhiko Shinohara, drummer Muneo Sagara, bassist/percussionist and Ryoichi Arimoto.For their sole album ''Uchuu Junkan'', released in 1978 on Columbia, Shinobue Takesan performs on strings and Takeru Muraoka, formerly a collaborator of Hiro Yanagida, provides the sax parts.

   An album split in 16 short tracks, scanning various musical styles, but instead of inconsistency you will get a mass of enjoyable, well-composed and fairly progressive tunes.With Ishima coming out FLOWER TRAVELLIN' BAND, it is quite reasonable that the album contains lots of spacey soundscapes, although this time they are delivered in a more melodic manner with careful synthesizer work and happy guitar work around, based on mid-tempo, optimistic rhythmic lines.The presence of Muraoka adds some lovely jazzy flavors in another package of pieces, while a few tracks even swirl around Folk and light, symphonic territories, based on the pastoral flute passages, the acoustic sounds of what appears to be a traditional Japanese string instrument and the deep sense of melody around.Despite being in 1978, the discreet organ and piano presence recalls the earlier years of the decade, while there are also some Pre-New Wave echoes in the album in a pair of tapping and very groovy cuts with a touch of funky beats within the process.Total mess you would think, but I tell you the joyful atmosphere is the main characteristic of the whole album and the music is played with good energy and inspiration.

   It is quite impressive the fact that keyboardist Nobuhiko Shinohara eventually appeared in Flower Travellin' Band reformation in mid-00's, almost three decades after Band Aide's only work.

   Very rare, propably Japanese-released only LP.Varied, optimistic, multi-influenced Art Rock of good to great quality.Warmly recommended.
