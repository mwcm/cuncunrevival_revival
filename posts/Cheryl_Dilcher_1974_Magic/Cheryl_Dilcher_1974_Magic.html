  "Congratulations to Cheryl Dilcher for pulling her act together. Her first [actually her second] album was dull, unmusical, and unsuccessful. This time she has gotten an interesting backup group together and, with the able help of producer Jeff Barry, created a provocative and aggressive album." M.A. (Morgan Ames) [High Fidelity, Oct. 1974, p. 129]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheryl Dilcher's second [actually, third] album, Magic moves easily between the gloss of a club presentation and the more sparing production of rock music. At first, she sounds a little like Grace Slick, and her guitar work on the instrumental 'Magic' sounds like Yes. Side one starts out strong with 'Magic' and 'Home to Me.''Home to Me' is about Los Angeles--'this town of superstars, You have to look like you're from Mars, For anyone to stop and even notice.' The L.A.-Southern California environment is noticeable on several of her other numbers as well, including 'You're the One,' and 'Dance.''The Devil Song' and 'It's A Secret' follow and are strong compositions, though very contrasting love songs: One is laid back and the other exultory. Poco's Rusty Young joins in on 'The Devil Song' with a restrained pedal steel guitar arrangement. 'Who's the Captain (Of Rock 'N Roll)' is good on side two, despite its somewhat confused lyrics. Cheryl Dilcher draws upon a number of sources and resources on MAGIC. Her voice and twelve string guitar are excellent, and she bats about .500 on her writing talents. She moves from a white gospel sound to rock and country. Where many female rock artists record introverted, intimate projects, Dilcher appears as an authentic and original rocker. She'll be around for some time to come." D.W. [Listening Post, Oct. 1974, p. 6.]

  "Producer Jeff Barry is not only rejuvenated and brought roughly up-to-date by the tough-cookie lyrics of Cheryl Dilcher, but in epics like 'You're the One' he sounds like he never left. She plays well-audible acoustic 12-string on every cut, but lest you be deceived she opens with the raga tongue of this Lp's title tune (MAGIC (A&amp;M SP 3640) to let you know that it's all rock 'n roll, no smoothtalking mellowed-back country hokum for this glitterized refugee from Allentown, Pennsy, no sir; she's even got Rusty Young on pedal steel in 'The Devil Song,' exorcism-rock, and Nino Tempo's conspicuous sax on the real killer, 'Fantasy.''Who's the Captain of Rock 'n Roll,' is for Columbus and Vespucci." [Zoo World; the Music Magazine, Aug. 15, 1974, p. 42.]
