   This is very likely to be the very last album by The Pretty Things, and apparently here is a band that feels tired after decades of exploring the various styles of rock-music, and should long be in bed by now. Or is there?

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the end of their long and unfortunately not always happy career, The Pretty Things grant themselves a look back at their most fruitful phase – at least artistically: the psychedelic years from ’67 to ’70. Of course, one has gotten slower and older, but the source of the old fire is still burning here. Most of all, it seems like a gift the band has made itself.

   It is true that All The Sweet Pretty Things… often is a plodding affair that also prefers darker chords, while the lighter moments mostly come from cover versions of peers of the band from the glorious 1960s (e.g. The Byrds’ “Rennaisance Fair”), but also the jam “Greenwood Tree”.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The original material can be best described as a sort of psychedelic desert-rock. “The Same Sun”, “And I do” or “Dark Days” all take the same line. “Turn my Head” recalls the more elated Pretty Things of old,  “Hell, Here and Nowhere” adds the blues that suddenly turns into a chanting chorus. The album then closes with the almost epic and slow-burning  “Dirty Song”.

   There is hardly anything to find fault with on this very convincing later work full of retro flair. If you deliver such a more than solid record, 50 years into your career, you can contentedly go to bed, I guess.
