  Yeah sure, everybody prattles on about these so-called “fucked up” records alla time to the point where the term loses its edge entirely. Is it REALLY fucked up, or does it merely offend the sensibilities of the same twits who have built little Ikea record collections based on MTV or “hipness”? Shit, some people think Ween or John Zorn is/was way out there, whereas I find them to be disposable pap that stole its soul from early Zappa (former) or Carl Stalling’s work on Warner Bros. cartoons (latter). Which brings me to an album that truly IS fucked up: Cromagnon’s ORGASM. Before I go too deep into scribing here, for history’s sake I’ll point out that this sucka appeared in 1968 on ESP-disk, mavericks among mavericks in the musick biz. They brought us Sun Ra’s HELLIOCENTRIC WORLDS, the first two Fugs platters, Albert Ayler’s SPIRITUAL UNITY, and of course, the entire catalog of proto-punk heroes, the Godz.

  Now, when you stick needle into groove that is opener, “Caledonia,” you’ll immediately think you’re listening to Einstürzende Neubauten gone black metal… then you’ll realize you’re WRONG and that there were no reference points such as that available in 1968. Geezus! Is that an army of bagpipes making that infernal racket??! Wow! The next track, “Ritual Feat of the Libido,” is simply “Caledonia” slowed down to 1/3 speed; it makes yer hands kinda clammy… music shouldn’t scare ya right? Especially not the kind made by two guys who useta write bubblegum hits that woulda make Herman’s Hermits blush??! Ooops! Shouldn’t listen to those voices in your head: not only is it possible, that’s exactly what’s happenin’. And who are these mantra-chanting freaks cryptically referred to as their “Connecticut Tribe”? OK, you can’t see me, but I’m shrugging my shoulders nervously…
