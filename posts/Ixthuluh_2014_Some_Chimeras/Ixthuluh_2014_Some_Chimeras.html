  This is typical Ixthuluh food, extended fusion-jams far out. However, and this is surprising, is the fact that the recording quality of this CD is much better than that, what Ixthuluh published 10 years ago. No idea where they unearthed this stuff. The music is not very different from the earlier recordings, but the better sound makes it much more pleasant by listening to these unconventional pieces. Especially Track 4 (the well disposed Lindworm starts like a Pop-Song and develops to fusion underground) and the Chamber Rock session (a wild mixture without any style) I like. This is really wild Kraut. Musically more catchy are the first three tracks, this is more fusion, similar to the first Ixthuluh release "Yes We Are A Jazzband". But more interesting I find the following thren tracks. The endlessly long closing track Superspych goes underground, as if Fat Freddy's Cat does a Zen meditation (10 hours motionless). Anyway, an interesting extension of Ixthuluh, I would not mind if they dig more of this better recorded material.
