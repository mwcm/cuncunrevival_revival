  Their sole album was released in 1977, and is very rare nowadays. It is fairly polished, country flavored southern rock, with a slick vocalist and great guitar on most cuts. Their sound is often reminiscent of The Charlie Daniels Band (if they were any good), and containing elements of Lynard Skynard and Molly Hatchet as well. This record [i]is[i] good, and consistently so. Finally reissued to boot!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A manageable, committed fan base is ready to spend enormous sums on this small country rock album. Prices of more than € 250.00 are not uncommon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I got away quite well with just under € 70.00. (Amsterdam Waxwell Records - great location, but you should really only do it with a clear turnip, otherwise it will be expensive because it is simply too tempting.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I have to admit: I am a little disappointed with the music! It has long been known among collectors that high prices are paid for rare exotics and the actual quality of the music does not necessarily have to be relevant. The main thing is that it is rare, maybe a private press, then it will be really expensive. So here too - with one exception, as we will see.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As soon as we put the needle into the groove we hear country rock, in the style of the seventies. Reminiscent of many German average hits of the time at the first casual listening. In the 70s, the Germans apparently made good use of the below-average American mainstream - some of them still do today. The first three tracks can therefore be checked off under "heard a thousand times".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first (and unfortunately only) listener is "Summer Night"; last title of the A-side. A really nice, calm and thematically complex folk rock song with acoustic guitar and a vintage string synth, good vocals and fine lyrics. Exotic chords, good lecture! Fits!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The B-side also starts pretty well with "Hitchhiking". A mid-tempo country rock song with piano, guitars and a flexible bass that likes to beat capers. Unfortunately that's about it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The saxophone strikes again at "Younger Days" - and anyone who knows my reviews knows that I do not necessarily count this instrument as one of my favorites. Therefore consequently: weakest song of the album. "Never Trust a Woman" and "On the Way" can no longer lift the level due to their conservative and uninspired country rock structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But then the magic happens and a couple of days later you come back for another spin, and another, and then another. and it grows on you and after a week or so it has crawled into your top 100 and it becomes your go to album at the end of another day of quarantine while you raid your booze cabinets...
