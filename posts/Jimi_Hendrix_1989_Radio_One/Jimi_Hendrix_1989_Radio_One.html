   It's only fitting that James Marshall Hendrix, along with bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, were featured several times during 1967 on the BBC radio airwaves, as the gifted guitarist made his first impression in the British market. While pushing out a pair of albums at the height of the psychedelic scene in '67, with the release of Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold As Love, and touring relentlessly, The Jimi Hendrix Experience performed on the BBC a total of five times over the course of the year. The collective recordings make up the Radio One disc.

   The BBC anthology consists of The Experience's appearances on Saturday Club, Top Gear and Alexis Korner's Rhythm &amp; Blues Show. From his first recorded BBC session on February 13 of 1967, Hendrix displayed his innovative approach. Armed with his inverted Fender, J.H. ruled the hard rock Strat-o-sphere with a sound that was completely out of character with the summer of love pop sound. Performing blues, funk and rock with passion, trumped-up with a wall of sound built on feedback and distortion, Hendrix explored new musical horizons.

   The seventeen song Radio One collection showcases Jimi at his improvising best. The compilation includes "Stone Free", covers of "Day Tripper", "Hey Joe" and "Killing Floor", plus "Fire", "Purple Haze", and "Foxy Lady". Combining his unique talent with the latest advances in equipment, Hendrix stretched out and let loose with abandon. Sustain took on a whole new meaning when Hendrix took over, and the cat was a master of fuzz box and wah-wah effects. Hendrix blew minds in '67 with furious fretboard work and an authoritative stage presence. In addition, Jimi quickly inspired countless musicians to alter their approach when playing guitar.

   Jimi Hendrix was a hard rock pioneer who left an incredible legacy despite a very brief run of serious six string amplification.
