  5th album by the excellent Keef Hartley Band, one the best Blues / Rock / Jazz ensembles ever, founded by drummer Keef Hartley following his stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. This live recording in London's legendary Marquee Club is a most ambitious project the band undertook, expanding its personnel to a full scale Big Band of 16 musicians, which included the best Jazz players on the UK scene at the time. The entire project was prompted by an invitation from the BBC to record live and the bandwagon got rolling from there. Alongside the Hartley regulars the additional players include trombonist Derek Wadsworth, saxophonist Barbara Thompson, trumpeter Harry Beckett and many more. Although the material is Blues based, in fact the orchestral arrangements and the entire concept is a tribute to great Jazz Big Bands, which were a great source of influence to Hartley. This is not only great music but also a great document of the times, when musical project could be made to come true regardless of their complexity and expense. Just sit back and succumb to the engulfing sound of the band in its full might – satisfaction guaranteed! Superb stuff!
