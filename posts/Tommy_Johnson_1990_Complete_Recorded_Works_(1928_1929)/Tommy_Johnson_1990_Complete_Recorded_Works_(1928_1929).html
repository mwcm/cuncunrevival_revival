  Before I go into more details about this album, just some general remarks, A very good friend of mine has been collecting these Austrian releases for the best part of the last 25 years, recently he decided to move back to the states, and I became the new proud guardian of his Document Records albums, other friends took care of different chunks of his collection. I told a couple of friends, I was told that some of these albums are quite hard to find, and that they had interest in copies of some of this material, so since this music is the roots of most of the beautiful crazy shit we listen to (And surfaces in so many jams of my favorite live bands), I thought some other guys out there might be curious about these old blues songs... So I will start posting some of it, with whatever info I might find, I am not a blues connoisseur by any means, so please if you have more info, or if I post something stupid, please let me know...

  Charley  Patton is often considered to be the father of the Mississippi Blues,  and the young, ill-fated Robert Johnson epitomised the Mississippi Blues  as its most agonised exponent. But there is no doubt that the music of  Tommy Johnson epitomised the Mississippi Blues at its most expressive  and poetic. Johnson achieved the perfection of a regional vocal and  instrumental tradition, while realising its potential for the  development of a unique and personal means of communication.
  <br/>
  The  Mississippi Delta is a wedge-shaped, fertile, blacklands region between  the Yazoo and the Mississippi Rivers. Near Drew, the heart of the Delta,  where so many blues singers lived, Tommy Johnson apparently met up with  the celebrated Charley Patton, and the encounter helped shape his  career. Barely eighteen, Tommy was soon back in Terry and playing hard  in the jukes, accompanying his brother LeDell. There he married one  Maggie Bidwell - very likely the Maggie Campbell of his song - and he  took her up to the Delta with him to exchange stanzas and musical ideas  with Patton, Willie Brown and the Drew musicians.
  <br/>
  If they  influenced him, in no way was Johnson a copyist; on the contrary, he was  an individualist, whose sense of timing and rhythm, sensitive guitar  playing, and impressive vocal range, were innate. They were brought  together in Memphis, in 1928, on some of the most memorable recordings  ever made of Mississippi Blues.
  <br/>
  Cool Drink Of Water with its loose  structure and unerring falsetto calls, the insistent momentum of Big  Road Blues, the field holler singing of Bye Bye Blues, and the melisma  of Lonesome Home Blues illustrate Johnson's combination of strength and  sensibility. On some titles he was complemented by the young Charlie  McCoy who played second guitar, mandolin-fashion, interweaving with  Johnson's deceptively relaxed instrumental line.
  <br/>
  In the main,  Tommy Johnson used traditional verses, remodelling them to suit the  overall theme of blues. But Canned Heat was a notable exception, a song  about his addiction to crude alcohol. In a later session, on which his  friend Ishman Bracey accompanied him on a couple of titles, he was less  well served by the infamous recording quality of the Paramount company.  But the quality of his blues was unimpaired on Slidinï¿½ Delta, and I  Wonder hints at the humour for which he was known among his friends.
  <br/>
  Perhaps  the most extraordinary story in this documentation of a remarkable  blues talent is the discovery, sixty years after it was made, of the  sole known copy of his coupling Riding Horse and Alcohol and Jake Blues.  A version of Maggie Campbell the former is much impaired, but on the  latter, which is adapted from Canned Heat, we can hear Tommy Johnson  fresh and relaxed, and at the height of his abilities. He lived on,  unrecorded, for a quarter of a century; much addicted, but much admired  and much copied by those who knew him.

  An essential  Tommy Johnson collection, Document's Complete Recorded Works (1928-1929)  features 17 songs from the Delta blues pioneer, including two  alternative takes and a pair of previously unissued songs known  respectively as "Morning Prayer Blues" and "Boogaloosa Blues." Culled  from the great Delta musician's recording sessions in Memphis and  Grafton, WI, from February 1928 to December 1929, this collection shines  a light on all of Johnson's known output during his most active  recording years. As with most music taken straight from original 78s,  the sound quality varies between tracks; all in all, the pops and static  aren't too distracting here. The music is well-worth seeking out as the  writing, guitar playing, and singing are all exceptional. ohnson's  voice, one of the distinctive early Delta blues voices along with Son  House and Charley Patton, changes from a deep rumble to a woeful  falsetto while his guitar playing is characteristic of the early Delta  style. With the exception of a few of the tracks from an August 1928  session, other players accompany Johnson on the tracks. Highlights  include the well-known material such as "Cool Drink of Water Blues" and  "Canned Heat Blues," as well as scratchy lesser-known gems from his  later sessions. The tracks "Ridin' Horse" and "Alcohol and Jake Blues"  were taken from what is believed to be the only remaining copy of the 78  they were originally released on. These two songs had not been released  on CD prior to this collection. On the two versions of "Black Mare  Blues" included, Johnson is joined by the New Orleans Nehi Boys,  featuring Kid Ernest Marshall on clarinet and Charley Taylor on piano.  This CD is highly recommended for those who have never heard Johnson's  music and equally recommended for those who have.

  Biography by Cub Koda
  <br/>
  Next  to Son House and Charley Patton, no one was more important to the  development of pre-Robert Johnson Delta blues than Tommy Johnson. Armed  with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to an eerie falsetto  range and a guitar style that had all of the early figures and licks of  the Delta style clearly delineated, Johnson only recorded for two years —  from 1928 to 1930 — but left behind a body of work that's hard to  ignore.
  <br/>
  The legend of Tommy Johnson is even harder to ignore. The  stories about his live performances — where he would play the guitar  behind his neck in emulation of Charley Patton's showboating while  hollering the blues at full throated level for hours without a break —  are part of it. So is his uncontrolled womanizing and alcoholism, both  of which constantly got him in trouble. Johnson's addiction to spirits  was so pronounced that he was often seen drinking Sterno-denatured  alcohol used for artificial heat — or shoe polish strained through bread  for the kick each could offer when whiskey wasn't affordable or  available in dry counties throughout the South. Then there's the  crossroads story. Yes, years before the deal with the Devil at a  deserted Delta crossroad was being used as an explanation of the  other-worldly abilities of young Robert Johnson, the story was being  told repeatedly about Tommy, often by the man himself to reinforce his  abilities to doubting audiences.
  <br/>
  Then there's the music. His  "Cool Water Blues" got amped up in the '50s by one of his early  admirers, Howlin' Wolf, and became "I Asked for Water (She Brought Me  Gasoline)." Another signature piece, his "Maggie Campbell," came with a  chord progression that was used for infinite variations by blues players  dating all the way back to his contemporary Charley Patton through  Robert Nighthawk. Two of his best-known numbers have survived into  modern times; "Big Road Blues" is probably best known to contemporary  blues fans from adaptions by Floyd Jones and others, while his "Canned  Heat Blues"— a bone-chilling account of his complete addiction to  alcohol and his slavish attempts to score it by whatever means necessary  — was the tune that gave a California blues-rock band their name. After  awhile, all of the above starts adding up, no matter how you slice it.  Tommy Johnson was one tough hombre, and a real piece of work.
  <br/>
  He  was born in 1896 in Hinds County, MS, on the George Miller plantation.  Once the family moved to Crystal Springs in 1910, Tommy picked up the  guitar, learning from his older brother, LeDell. By age 16, Johnson had  run away from home to become a "professional" musician, largely  supporting himself by playing on the street for tips. By the late  teens-early '20s, Tommy was frequently playing the company of rising  local stars Charley Patton, Dick Bankston and Willie Brown, their  collective ouevre planting seed, later becoming the first greening of  the Mississippi Delta blues. Johnson spent most of the '20s drinking,  womanizing, gambling, and playing in the company of Rubin Lacy, Charley  McCoy, Son Spand, Walter Vincent, and Ishmon Bracey when the money got  low and apparently, only when the mood struck him. By all acounts, Tommy  felt no particular drive to relentlessly promote himself and — while he  played music for pay until the very end of his life — he certainly  wasn't as serious about his career as he was about his drinking. He cut  his first records for the Victor (later RCA Victor, now BMG) label at  sessions held in Memphis, TN, in 1928. Johnson's first releases hit the  area hard, inspiring a raft of up and comers that reads like the  proverbial who's who list; you could easily count Howlin' Wolf, Robert  Nighthawk, Houston Stackhouse, Floyd Jones, Boogie Bill Webb, K.C.  Douglas, Johnny "Geechie" Temple, and Otis Spann among his many  disciples.
  <br/>
  He cut one more stack of great records for the  Paramount label in 1930, largely through the maneuvering of fellow  drinking buddy Charley Patton. Then the slow descent into alcoholism  started taking its toll, the one too many nights of Sterno and shoe  polish buzzes reducing his once prodigious talents to small, sporadic  flickerings of former genius. He worked on a medicine show with Ishmon  Bracey in the '30s, but mostly seemed to be a mainstay of the juke and  small party dance circuit the rest of his days. He was playing just such  a local house party in November of 1956 when he suffered a fatal heart  attack and went out in probably the exact fashion he wanted to. Whether  the story about the deal with the Devil at the crossroads was something  he truly believed or just something Johnson said to drum up local  interest in himself, it seems odd that you'll find him buried at the  Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery in Crystal Springs. Maybe he  mellowed out towards the end, maybe he found God. Some things about the  blues you'll never know, no matter how many computers you hook up to it.
