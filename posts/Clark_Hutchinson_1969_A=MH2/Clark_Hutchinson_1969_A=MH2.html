  Two musicians, Andy Clarke and Mick Hutchinson, recorded this album in two twelve hour sessions, playing all instruments between them including bass, keyboards, rhythm and lead guitar and various percussion instruments, and as the sleeve notes stress, " no technical wizardry or trickery", meaning good old fashioned musicianship! Many influences on this their first album such as flamenco guitar, "raga" style and various ethnic rhythms all work together creating a very interesting listen. All are technical masterpieces, though by today's standards they may sound somewhat basic, and only using an eight track recording studio. For 1969 made very interesting listening as eastern music was very popular then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Improvisation on a Modal Scale" - improvisation is the word here, some excellent guitar soloing over a repeated theme as in most of the tracks here followed by the beautiful "Acapulco Gold" which features some masterly flamenco style "slightly amplified" guitar playing, the sleeve notes strongly state "no double tracking" - ok i believe them!.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Impromptu in E Minor" crashes in, a rather Bolero style beat overplayed with a rather tinny sounding rhythm guitar and piano, followed by distorted lead guitar solo, leading up to that Bolero-style build up complete with male voice choir! I like it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Textures in 3/4" begins with a rather native american style intro using drum and maraccas, introducing a sax solo with flutes which build into a very pleasant piece, interspersed with lead guitar and piano solos creating a distinctly eastern- style hypnotic effect, leading up to the longest track on the album "Improvisation on an Indian Scale" which seems to attract the most attention to this album, it is 13.5 minutes of eastern magic, very popular music at the time, and according to the sleeve notes "brings forth some of the most skilful intricate and fastest guitar work ever put to disc.." i won't dispute that as there is some fine playing on this album which would interest musicians or simply the curious, but may be lost on those less interested in musicianship but those who just like to hear a good song. 37 years on this does sound rather simple to modern ears but i enjoy the album immensely and would recommend it as a very interesting piece of early, though unusual progressive music.
