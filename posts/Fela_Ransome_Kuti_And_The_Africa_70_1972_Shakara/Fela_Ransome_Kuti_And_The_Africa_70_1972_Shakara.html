   This is, to my ears, the first Fela masterpiece, with not a moment of un-funky, non-transcendent groove to be found. There would be plenty more, but they all follow this same formula: Fela, in a political rage, channeling his anger through tight grooves, interweaving guitar lines, horn charts, and his own smooth organ playing into a patchwork that fill every second with ecstatic bliss. Roforofo Fight had hinted at this but had too much fat; here, Fela trims it and delivers a totally flawless gem.

   Shakara is one of the most upbeat and exciting albums in the Fela catalogue.  The group is in its prime with two fifteen minute cuts that layout the formula for much of his seventies output.  The two tracks are remarkably alike with Fela's trademark riff accompanied by spidery guitar riffs, James Brown influenced grooves and some of the sharpest horn arrangements you are ever likely to hear.  Usually there are groovy sax solos in the instrumental portion of the tune (and more trumpets than usual on Lady) or a keyboard solo that sounds like a mix between an electric piano and a distorted harpsichord.  At approximately the half way point of the tune, the massive vocal chants start.  Lady is a controversial lyric but really one that forms a part of the Fela Kuti philosophy of African unity that is espoused on almost every album.  Even if the thought behind it might seem impossibly regressive, you have to admire an artist who was so singularly committed to his politics.  So... the tune won't win over any of your feminist friends when you crank it at your party, but it will get them dancing.
