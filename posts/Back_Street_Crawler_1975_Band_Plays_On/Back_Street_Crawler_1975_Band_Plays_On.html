   Just as Ritchie Blackmore replaced the guitar player of Elf with himself and became Blackmore’s Rainbow. Paul Kossoff replaces the guitar player from the band Bloontz, and renames the band Back Street Crawler, naming it after his solo album. Their debut album hit the shelves in 1975.

   The song “Jason Blue” is a powerful potion, one that would fit perfectly on a classic hits station, arguably one of the best tracks here. It is one of six compositions by Mike Montgomery, the major force on this album. Montgomery co-writes two additional tunes and sings lead on “All the Girls Are Crazy” and “Survivor”, dueting with Terry Wilson-Slesser on “New York, New York”.

   The more you play “Band Plays On”, the more it grows on you. Sounding so much like Bad Company was no doubt a drawback — the records showing up in the same section alphabetically at retail bins, their names so closely aligned, the unfortunate big difference for Back Street Crawler was no hit single emerging from this set. “It’s a Long Way Down to the Top” could be Bad Company performing “Ready for Love”, down to the riff and the mood.

   Nevertheless, so many references to that band don’t take away from the fact that this is a solid ’70s blues-rock disc with hooks, top-notch production, and lots to offer. This material is terrific sleeper stuff for the ’70s hard rock genre, before Foreigner made that whole world much slicker. Back Street Crawler creates real hard rock art.
