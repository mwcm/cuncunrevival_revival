  Here’s one of the most staggering, energetically-strenuous, bedlam-hoisting dynasties in explosive bisecting Free Jazz intensity. As independent musician’s these laureates each excel in their own immense pedigree, but as a trio entity they fused &amp; co-founded a hulking opalescent deluge of atom splintering, non-negotiable, prolonged-pandemonium-pummel-prism &amp; volleyed forth a massive concatenation of consistently eviscerating recordings with a reliability &amp; emblem of quality for the most excruciatingly effusive of outbursts. Lead &amp; founded by pianist Yosuke Yamashita, most references encountered refer to him as “The Japanese Cecil Taylor”! Taylor has clearly been a tremendous inspiration for Yosuke who has frequently eulogized him &amp; lavished his idol with the highest of adulation as well as sharing at least one performance together. But Yosuke &amp; indeed his trio are no epigone or second-rate plagiarists. Paired with long time affiliate saxophonist Akira Sakata, an absolute madman of screaming, implacable excoriation, manic instability &amp; one of the most truly ferocious, precise &amp; demolishingly devastating drummers of all time Takeo Moriyama, they unleash an unimaginably ascetic sustained avalanche of bellicosity &amp; divine-wrath of mythical man-beast mensuration. like martial-deities, they foment an allo-secular degree of extremes, urgency, threat &amp; sybaritic smouldering impetuosity &amp; emotion-lead rampageous incandescence.
