   Twenty years and more ago I used to listen to this album a lot, then one of the people I shared a flat with came in when I was listening to it and abused me for listening to supermarket music - perhaps that shook my confidence but I haven't listened to it that much in recent years. While there is something a little middle of the road about this, a pleasant and unobjectionable background noise, there is also a lot of fine playing. It is very much Keith Jarrett joining Gary Burton's band, but Jarrett is more than just a guest, providing 5 of the 6 themes, giving the music an unmistakable Jarretian quality. If we compare this music to that of Jarrett's quartet of the time, its big failing is that the rhythms provided by Steve Swallow's bass and Bill Goodwin's drums are almost blundering when put beside the work of Charlie Haden and Paul Motion in Jarrett's regular band: it's all very bouncy but very straight forward, but there are no surprises, none of the irregularities that Haden and Motion come up with. If there was a computer dating system for jazz musicians, Jarrett and Burton would be a perfect match: they have the same love of pleasant riffs, catchy tunes, those clever chord changes that feel as though they are shifting gear – but this makes them a bit too similar: they are like a couple who always talk to each other using the most treacly endearments, after a while you think enough is enough. They bring the worst out in each other. But this is a bit unfair: they both play very well on this album and have an understanding of each other’s music: listen to Moonchild where the vibes and piano bellow around each other like clouds, changing shape, reforming. In some ways my favourite musician on the album is Sam Brown – his guitar often seems clumsy, a bit crude, but against the slightly over-pretty professionalism of the main two musicians he sounds refreshing.
