   Super flute may sound a little cheesy album title and it reminds me of those cheap Italian, German or British cover albums that were released by the dozens in the 1970s. But as you know, one should never judge the record by it’s title - or cover. Ken Munson plays his flute like the greats Herbie Mann or Moe Koffman, but instead of jazziness, he does it more soulful way. The title track “Super flute” is a great uptempo funky track with breaks and all. And there’s more groovers as well. Uptempo flute funk tracks “Scramble” and “Papa was a rolling stone” with midtempo “Rocks in my bed”, “Back stabbers” and “Ode to Billy Joe” are enough for a reason to buy this one. Although little is known of Kenneth “Ken” Munson, I must admit that Super flute is really a magnificent album. It always gets you to a good mood no matter what…

   Fans of Bobbi Humphrey’s Mizell Brothers-produced LPs for Blue Note, as well as Harold Alexander’s dates for Flying Dutchman, should add to their wants’ lists Ken Munson’s Super Flute. Munson isn’t quite in the same league as Humphrey or Alexander, mind you, but his flute playing is effortlessly funky, and listeners with a preference for the first half of the soul-jazz equation will find much to savor. Munson keeps the music feather-light and upbeat, drawing most of his material from the contemporary pop charts – familiar melodies like “I Can See Clearly Now,” “Back Stabbers,” and “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” glisten and glide, buoyed by sweetly soulful arrangements and flute breaks that soar and twist like lightning bugs at dawn….. by Jason Ankeny….allmusic…~
