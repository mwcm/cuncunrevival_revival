   After the wonderful album "Huség", East moved away from the symphonic rock toward the eigthies, new wave-is sounding art rock, a'la Rush's Signal album. They did this from their own decision. New singer, József Tisza came in the band, his voice was similar like old singer. The opening "Rések a falon ~ Cracks in the wall" is very catchy pop song with serious lyrics about the orwellian paranoia, what the people felt in the communism behind the iron curtain. "Az idegen ~ The stranger" is sad, nostalgic song about a man, who got back locale of the childhood. This is little old East sounding with short, but good guitar solo. "Mintha mégis ~ As if" average pop- rock song. "Száguldj velem ~ Race with me" almost started like Tom Sawyer, vocal shared Péter Móczan and József Tisza. An istrumental number, "Különvonaton ~ Private train" closes the first side of the vinyl. "Földközelben ~ Flying low" is a simple radio friendly new wave song. The next one, "Brainwash" is electronic new wave rock, with vocoder. "Az utolsó éjszaka ~ The last night" is the best song,here we can hear near resemblance to the old East sound. "Az óra jár ~ The clock is running" is very energetic number with great synth solo in the middle. The last "Tánc a parázson ~ Dancing on members"is an instrumental too. The band tried to balance between the old good progressive rock and the modern aor-ish, new wave-ish music, but it didn't succeed perfectly. The music sounds rather dated, but the words become in our days more actual.

   A head on collision between Art &amp; Illusion era Twelfth Night and... A Flock of Seagulls. Sung in Hungarian mind you. Many Neo Prog bands weren't that far from the mainstream, truth be told. Not a bad album at all really, though one does need to have their early 80s MTV T-Shirt on for sure. Side 2 is considerably stronger, and the final cut proves that progressive rock could have seamlessly merged with the Synthpop movement after all. Oh well.
