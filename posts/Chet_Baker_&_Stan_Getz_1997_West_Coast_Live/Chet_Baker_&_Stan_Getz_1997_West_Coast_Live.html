   June 12, 1953 was to have been another regular Monday at the Haig with Gerry Mulligan's pianoless quartet featuring Chet Baker. However, a lifestyle conflict between Gerry and the L.A. County Sheriff's office caused his absence that night. The band would eventually evolve into the Chet Baker quartet with Russ Freeman on piano. But that night, Stan Getz was enlisted to sub for Mulligan. These historic performances are here, complete and with the best possible sound, for the 1st time. Also includes 3 bonus audienceless performances

   One of the most infamously acrimonious musical unions transpired between two of the leading purveyors of West Coast cool jazz: Chet Baker (trumpet) and Stan Getz (tenor sax). Their paths crossed only a handful of times and West Coast Live captures two of their earliest encounters in Los Angeles at the Haig on June 12, 1953, and the Tiffany Club on August 17, 1953. These recordings have been issued in Europe and Japan ad infinitum in varying degrees of quality, completeness, and often sporting erroneous data. However, enthusiasts should note that West Coast Live is the only release derived from producer/engineer Dick Bock's own master reels. For two men who purportedly would rather not be in the same room at the same time, Baker and Getz are able to create some legitimately brilliant improvisation. For the Haig set, Getz had been brought in to co-lead a quartet with Baker for an incarcerated Gerry Mulligan. Musically the results vacillate. There are moments of sheer inspiration, such as the musical cat and mouse demonstrated on "Strike up the Band" or the straight-ahead driving-bop lines the two bandy on "Yardbird Suite," which includes tasty solos from Carson Smith (bass) and Larry Bunker (drums). There are likewise the brass entanglements that plague "The Way You Look Tonight" as well as the opening of "Winter Wonderland," which suffers from the "too many cooks" syndrome. The second and shorter set is taken from a recording session held during the afternoon -- hence the lack of an audience response after each number -- at the Tiffany Club. Baker's quartet at the time featured Russ Freeman (piano) and Shelly Manne (drums), as well as Carson Smith (bass), who reprised his role at the heart of this quintet. All three tracks contain very little in the way of interaction between Baker and Getz, featuring more of the support trio than the two co-leads.

   This is a surprisingly well-recorded two hours worth of West Coast Jazz recorded in 1953-54 Los Angeles. I use the word "surprisingly" here because Most live sessions from the early-to-mid 50s which have gone unreleased for over 40 years suffer from poor-to-sub-par recording quality. No such problem here--all the instruments are clear and the recording approaches studio quality. It's a nice engineering job from producer Richard Bock.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Stan Getz plays well here--his playing seems to endlessly flow from a seemingly inexaustable well. The saxophonist, however, tries mighty hard to invoke the chemistry Baker effortlessly had with Gerry Mulligan (improvised counterpoint, fugal-like filigrees, etc), but you can't TRY for chemistry. It has to happen naturally. It doesn't quite happen here, but man, does Getz put forth an effort to make the magic materialize! His playing is relaxed and technically impressive, but at times comes across as too cool, too lacking in emotion. In fact, downright cold in places. Stan would not have this problem in the 60s, but it plagues him to an extent here, despite the easy flow of his improvisations.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Chet's playing here is warmer than Getz's, but he has played better on other Pacific Jazz releases, notably Jazz at Ann Arbor and Quartet with Russ Freeman. Plus, he seems to be a little bit off-mike at times. Nevertheless, it you like West Coast Jazz, you're bound to enjoy the two CDs presented here. I would actually give this release 3 1/2 stars if I could.

   ABOUT THE LINER NOTES: Having James Gavin write the liner notes for a Chet Baker release is akin to asking the late Albert Goldman to write the liner notes for a John Lennon album, or asking Mitch Miller to pen the liner notes for the new Rolling Stones reissue (it seems as if the Stones have some kind of new reissue every other week!). That Gavin has a vendetta against Baker is obvious from reading his Baker biography "Deep in a Dream" where he tears Chet a new one. I mean, Gavin totally raked poor Chet over the coals as a trumpet player(occasional faint praise above the endless damnation) and supposed rip-off artist who merely imitated Miles Davis and couldn't sing his way out of a wet paper bag. In fact, Gavin is particularly savage and cruel in his brutal condemation of Chet's vocalising. Despite this, Gavin was paid to write the liner notes for not only this CD, but the Embraceable You CD as well, a vocal album where Baker sings about 90% of the material!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So my question is this: If James Gavin is so utterly critical of Chet as a musician (we can overlook his critcism of Chet as a person, most of which was deserved), why did the suits at Capitol (who own the PJ catalog) hire him to write the liner notes to this and other CDs on that label? Why not someone who actually APPRECIATES Chet's playing and singing? Didn't the powers that be read "Deep in a Dream?" I just find something incredibly wrong about choosing this critic to write these notes!

   But he does praise Chet's playing in the liner notes here. I am reminded of Nat Hentoff, who put down organist Jimmy Smith in review after review in Down Beat for being "too raucous" and "not relaxed enough." (Hentoff acutally preferred boring, coma-inducing Les Strand as an organist; even Lawrence Welk's organ player was far more swinging than Strand, believe it or not). This went on for years, UNTIL Hentoff, for some unknown reason, was paid to write the liner notes for a Jimmy Smith album, whereupon he suddenly LIKED Jimmy Smith's organ playing, despite putting it down for years on end. Maybe that's why James Gavin suddenly thinks Baker is a great trumpet player here. In other words, to paraphrase Bob Dylan, money doesn't talk, it swears!
