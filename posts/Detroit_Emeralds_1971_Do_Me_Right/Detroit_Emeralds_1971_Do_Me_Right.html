   In the same year that I felt my soul move, I got a little bit more into soul. I know it is only 2019 as I write this and that the set/setting are one in the same for a time, but I know that there will never be a time of my life that I'm both surrounded by amazing soul music and completely ignorant of what I should be taking away from said music. Do not get me wrong: I am not being willfully unknowing to the LPs and singles and esteemed variations (northern soul, philly soul, chicago soul, southern soul, smooth soul, psychedelic soul, what the shit?), but it hits me like a barrage and in understanding what the context of a life lived with knowing one's soul is like. Most people who hear that you believe in a soul do the ordinary: they assume you are like most people, but forget to account for the fact that this may be a recent discovery of yours. But what reason have you given to indicate that you only felt that soul wiggle at age 22? Maybe the person you are speaking to felt it at 8 and never stopped feeling it. This is the problem of how being in tune with one's self is not enough for people to be compatible in all matters of love. Love is universal but also succinct and in many varieties, and the love I feel from soul music when it has a message for me is beyond incomprehensible to what I know of the English language. I am hoping to know how to do it better with each one of these passing albums.

   The Detroit Emeralds do nothing extraordinary, but they also don't tell about the origin of how they got to here in 1971. Much in the way that we cannot blame others for not knowing our insecurities untransmitted, this act hasn't a clue that they could spice things up and get a bit closer to the pineal microphone. It's like they're doing every step of soul music the way they were told and the way it was seen, but really, what essential hit came from Do Me Right with a message that wasn't, "I'll be your man, tonight or tomorrow or whenever." I'm bored of all music like that so it makes it unfortunate that I didn't get into a song like "Wear This Ring (With Love)" in 1998. Being six and thinking about two years after the moon landing? Not I. I think when I was six, my favorite song was... oh good lord, no I'm not admitting that here.

   I like this though. I know I usually have a third paragraph assurance of that, but it's the truth on an album like this. I don't appreciate how patriarchal fascinating this record seems to find itself. There's nothing emphatic worth singing about on any of these songs, but they have okay voices.

   A gem of a record from the mighty Detroit Emeralds – a group who are really finding a new 70s vibe here, while still holding onto all the rich harmonies they developed on their early singles! The trio work here together with a fluid sound and the kind of harmonies you might have heard from The Impressions a few years before – but they also get a really unique groove that befits their presence on Detroit's legendary Westbound label – a style that's maybe a bit more heady, and sometimes righteous!
