   SUN TREADER was a fusion group formed by Alyn ROSS (RED BUDDHA THEATRE), Morris PERT (BRAND X, COME TO THE EDGE) and Peter ROBINSON (BRAND X, QUATERMASS, ABLUTION). These quite known musicians in the world of prog fusion worked together in this more obscure project during the early 70's playing a bit more improvisational style of fusion with some oriental touches, possibly inspired by their experience collaborating with STOMU YAMASH'TA. They officially released only one album 'Zin Zin' in 1973, but in 2001 an archival record was published that featured studio recordings from the mid-70's when Alyn ROSS was replaced by New Zealand bass player Nevile WHITEHEAD (from KEITH TIPPETT GROUP).

   Sounds a lot like a Stomu Yamash'ta album he never released. It's a pretty basic setup, where Fender is usually creating fusion ambience with some eastern percussive elements thrown into the mix. None of this is very original, if you've heard the japanese dude i mentioned, you'll know how it sounds(and he's way more interesting). The B-side is the better one, which at least tries to cross into some more diverse ground, but never really makes it. Definitely not a bad avant-fusion attempt, though it suffers from one dimensionality and lack of ideas. A technically stellar perfomance of music doesn't mean its arrangements are as stellar.
