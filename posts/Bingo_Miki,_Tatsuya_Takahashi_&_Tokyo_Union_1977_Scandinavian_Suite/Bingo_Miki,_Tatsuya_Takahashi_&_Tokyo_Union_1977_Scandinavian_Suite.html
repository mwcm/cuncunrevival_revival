   Japanese composer, arranger and tenor saxophonist Bingo Miki studied at Berklee School of Music and with the famed composer George Russell before he went back to Japan and started working for Tatsuya Takahashi and The Tokyo Union. Although he was still young and virtually unknown, the Three Blind Mice producer Takeshi Fujii was deeply impressed by Miki's talent and comissioned a suite for a recording project to celebrate the label's seventh anniversary.

   Big band pyrotechnics by the 20-piece Tokyo Union. This is no sleepy Scandinavian voyage, more a groovy collection of orchestra and electronics in the shape of six varied stormers written by legendary Japanese bandsman Bingo Miki and perhaps a little more accessable and funky then some of the big band outings released under his own name around the same period.

   Familiar orchestral colours are melded with more progressive and funky arrangements and styles of the period culminating with the monstrous cop-show theme sounding "Children At Play". A surprising and original jazz album that's a pleasure from start to finish.

   The result was the six-part Scandinavian Suite, the inspiration for which was drawn in part by Miki's experience when he had spent 10 months in Finland, and this ambitious and magnificent recording that stands now as a landmark in the history of orchestral jazz in Japan. Mostly modal compositions and prominent use of synthesizers and electric guitars reflect the time (1977). The performance and recording are equally as brilliant as the composition itself.
