   Recording on August 5th, 1966 along with fellow percussionist, the late Sonny Morgan. According to Milford Graves, the titles were given numbers according to how many beats were in each measure. Milford Graves has been one of the main drummers in the free mode scene (known for skillful inclusion of Asian and African rhythmic ingredients into his solos). He worked with the New York Art Quartet, Giuseppi Logan, Albert Ayler, Don Pullen, Andrew Cyrille and many more. This unique combination of percussion conversations between Milford Graves is a welcomed addition in the new series of digipak re-issues. Liner notes, photos and more... digitally remastered from the original tapes.

   Free jazz recordings that consist of nothing but percussion instruments are a rarity. For that matter, percussion-only recordings are a rarity in any type of jazz, be it fusion, swing, classic jazz, hard bop, cool jazz, post-bop, third stream, soul-jazz, or Dixieland. But Milford Graves Percussion Ensemble is, in fact, a rare example of a free jazz recording that offers percussion instruments exclusively -- no trumpet, fl√ºgelhorn, or cornet; no saxophones; no bass or cello; no acoustic piano or electric keyboards; no vibes; no accordion. Just percussion instruments from start to finish. This 1965 session finds Milford Graves forming a duo with fellow drummer Sonny Morgan; in addition to his drums, Graves provides bells, gongs, and shakers -- and Morgan also contributes some bells. But if the idea of a free jazz recording that adheres to an "all percussion all the time" policy sounds intriguing, the reality is that Percussion Ensemble (which ESP-Disk reissued on CD in 2008) isn't nearly as interesting as some might hope. Graves and Morgan's performances are aimless and not terribly inspired; unlike many of the avant-garde jazz recordings that Graves was a part of in the 1960s, this 33-minute disc never really catches fire and never goes anywhere. And after Percussion Ensemble is finished playing, the listener is left asking, "OK, what's the point? What is he trying to say?" Graves had his share of creative successes over the years; he is a talented drummer, and his more substantial performances are an asset to jazz's avant-garde. But the disappointing Percussion Ensemble is only recommended to completists.
