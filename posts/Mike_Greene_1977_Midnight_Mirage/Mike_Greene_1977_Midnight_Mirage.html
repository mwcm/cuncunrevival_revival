   Mike Greene was originally a member of the Hampton Grease Band - one of the wildest fusion outfits you never heard. Formed in Atlanta, Georgia during the tumultuous late '60s, Hampton Grease Band developed a big hippie following with their crazy experimental style and playing free shows throughout the South as well as supporting bands like Fleetwood Mac, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Captain Beefheart, Grateful Dead, Procol Harum and Jimi Hendrix. The group signed with CBS, releasing their one and only album 'Music to Eat' in 1971 which sold next to zero, eventually signing to Frank Zappa's Straight Records only to break-up in 1973. Following the split, Greene put together the Mike Greene Band releasing two albums on Mercury 'Pale, Pale Moon' in 1975 and a year later 'Midnight Mirage'.

   Both albums are classic examples of Southern fusion and 'Midnight Mirage' is a good as it gets. Often you'll find Mike Greene in the Jazz sections of your local shop, or described as such by some internet sellers, but this is only partially true. This is heat-fried fusion with elements of world music and pop thrown on the fire. A lot of warm vibes here and Greene is a competent vocalist somewhat in the Michael Franks / Dan Fogelberg school as well as wonderful sax player which is a featured prominently throughout the record. Surrounded with stellar musicians that weave a colourful tapestry of sound, including his old bud in Hampton Grease Band - bassist Michael Holbrook; fans of Sea Level and the Allman Brothers Band should make space for this record in their collections and from the opening cut 'Joni' you get the feeling this is going to be something special. A few of the many highlights include the title track; a rockish instrumental featuring tasty guitar work from David Michael, the funky and sweet 'Perfect Smile' and the Allman Brothers influenced 'Adobe Highway' making for a dazzling album of light and dark tones and musical riches.

   Mike Greene's albums have never been on CD which may very well be politically motivated. Following 'Midnight Mirage', Greene became increasingly active in the music business, eventually becoming president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences as well as running the 'Grammy' Awards for several years. Consistently controversial for the way he operated the Grammy's, promoted his own music to major labels and allegations of sexual impropriety eventually lead to his resignation in 2002.

   This is a nice, easy to listen to album. Kinda jazzy and light. All the musicians know their craft and do a very good job playing together as a tight ensemble. I’ve played this album since I bought it in the late 70’s and it’s still a satisfying listening experience today. I don’t have a whole lot else to say about it. Give it a listen and see if you want to hear it again after you’ve played it thru once. I’d be surprised if you don’t find it a nice addition to your musical collection. Just another one more of those bands that fell in between the cracks and deserves a chance to be heard.
