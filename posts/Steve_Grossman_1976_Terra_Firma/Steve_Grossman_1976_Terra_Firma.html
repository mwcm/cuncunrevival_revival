     A stone slammer from saxophonist Steve Grossman – and a set that's served up in the same funky style as the best work by the related Stone Alliance combo! The core trio features tremendous interplay between the hard-biting tenor of Steve Grossman the funky bass of Gene Perla, and slamming drums and percussion of Don Alias – and the set also features some great contributions from Jan Hammer on keyboard – playing Fender Rhodes and moog with a wonderfully funky, soulful style – quite different than some of his more jamming work with other artists. There's a really sharp, angular feel to the whole set – electric grooves that are heavy on rhythms, yet also have a nice sense of freedom on the tenor – and titles include "This Way Out", "Inmate Man", "Katonah", "Enya", and "In It"

     Heavy,hard blowing sax from Steve Grossman in a fusion setting with two of his band mates from Stone Alliance and Jan Hammer on keyboards. Essentially a fusion record very much in the late seventies mode that is made to stand above a crowded fusion market by Grossman's super intense playing.Make no mistake he blows hard on this LP and his playing is far from the lighter sounds that were the curse of many of the periods fusion records.His style owes a lot to Rollins and Trane but this is no bad thing.Hammer bubbles away producing all sorts of sounds from his Moog and other keyboards and the rhythm section of Don Alias and Gene Perla add the funk.
