  As members of Bangor Flying Circus, guitarist Alan De Carlo and singer/keyboardist David "Hawk" Wolinski recorded a decent 1969 album for ABC Dunhill. When that outfit folded in 1970, the pair elected to continue their partnership as the Chicago-based Madura with the addition of drummer Ross Salomone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finding a sponsor in the form of James William Guerico (who'd enjoyed considerable success with The Buckinghams and The Chicago Transit Authority), the trio subsequently won a contract with Columbia Records. With Guerico producing, at least to my ears much of 1971's "Madura" sounded like an early Chicago album though thankfully without the irritating horns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all three members sharing writing duties (there was one outside cover), the collection bounced around between pop ('I Think I'm Dreaming'), FM-oriented rock ('Drinking No Wine'), jazzy interludes (''My Love is Free'), and more experimental excursions ('Hawk Piano'). These guys were clearly quite talented. Wolinski had a nice voice that sounded a bit like a cross between Chicago's Terry Kath and Robert Lamm, (he also played a mean Hammond organ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Carlo also had a decent voice and a knack for spinning off catchy jazz-tinged solos. While there were several strong compositions, allowing the trio to stretch out over four sides was probably a mistake since it forced them to fill up lots of space with poorly deigned jams and experimentation ('Plain as Day').
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard to imagine Columbia, or any major label allowing a new band to debut with a double album, nineteen track set in this day and age . A second album recorded in 1972 and released early 1973 before the band split and each one of the members took their own road.
