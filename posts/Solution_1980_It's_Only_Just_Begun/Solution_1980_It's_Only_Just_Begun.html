  Like if the preceding album "fully interlocking" was not accessible and pop enough, the band here REALLY made a serious attempt to be on the radio broadcast level. You know what, their formula really works for me: tons of pleasant, joyful songs full of lead &amp; backing vocals, saxes, woodwinds instruments, rythmic keyboards. The songs are very very catchy and addictive. The bass and drums are absolutely well played and are not minimalist at all: the ensemble is amazingly well synchronized!! They may sound just slightly like SPYRO GYRA, less jazzy. Finally, this is pop sophisticated rock/fusion/jazz, and yes, "it is only just begun".
