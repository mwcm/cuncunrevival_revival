   Recorded when she was at the peak of popularity, a result of her stint with Chick Corea's Return to Forever, 500 Miles High presents Flora Purim in concert at the 1974 Montreux Jazz Festival. Accompanied by an all-star band including guitarist David Amaro, flutist Herbie Mann, keyboardist Pat Rebillot, bass legend Ron Carter, and husband (and star in his own right) Airto Moreira on drums, vocals, and various percussion, the Brazilian songstress delivers a fiery performance that must have been a joy to behold. Strictly speaking, this is really more of a band album than a Flora Purim album, as Airto and the guys are featured for extended instrumental romps. However, when Purim is in the spotlight, her vocal magic lifts the proceedings to a high level. The trademark "500 Miles High" is wilder and more electric than in its Return to Forever studio version. Special guest Milton Nascimento leads the ensemble through his "Cravo e Canela" (Cinnamon and Cloves), a joyously percussive highlight of the show. Elsewhere, Airto joins his wife for a vocal give-and-take while the band cooks along underneath. The lengthy set closer, "Jive Talk," is really more a showcase for him than for his wife, but when it kicks into high gear, it provides a scorching climax highlighted by the twosome's wordless vocals. Although a fine document of her live show, 500 Miles High is probably not the best place to go for an introduction to the vocal artistry of Flora Purim. Stories to Tell and Butterfly Dreams would serve this purpose better, as would Corea's Light as a Feather. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyably eclectic and exciting outing.

   Dreamy Rhodes arpeggios and Airto chimes, introduce Flora’s silky voice “O Cantador”, over Ron Carter sparse double bass notes; tension slowly mounts with stronger chords and cymbals;
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A drum roll and Flora’s vocalizations introduce a furious rhythm, swinging bass and jazzy chaotic Rhodes chords which are a “Bridge” to the lovely guitar line opening “500 Miles High”; a Corea tune is given a bossa jazz treatment; 1st Flora vocalizations then David Amaro’s slightly distorted Gibson solo take you HIGH ! The mood calms down with Ron’s soloing over DA jazzy progressions; the band resumes in up-tempo mode ending in a great climax!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Next song has a special guest, Milton! Two of Brazil’s most interesting singers/musicians together “Cravo e Canela”, driven by Milton acoustic playing over the band in full bossa-jazz mode; RC jams with Airto Moreira,1st on shaking percussions then on berimbau…when the 2 singers take the tune back, Airto joins on vocals and over a driving instrumental the song ends.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Baia” opens side 2, with a heart melting electric guitar line over a rich rhythm arrangement and Flora’s heavenly vocals; AM takes the drum stool and together with Roberto Silva do a climaxing percussion ending.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   RC deep bass introduces “The Wind” in Flora’s voice, as you feel yourself walking on the beach on a cloudy moon lit night; Airto tribal chants , over free flowing keyboards (Pat Rebillot and Wagner Tirso) and percussions; sweet Rhodes and organ lines later make the perfect background for Flora’s melodic ending;
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Jive” opens, again with a berimbau that should have left Montreux fascinated, a traditional inspired Hermeto Pascoal tune; you feel yourself sailing up the Amazon river, straight into the middle of an Indian village ceremony…then in a old Portuguese founded Brazilian town…Airto vocalizations then introduce DA guitar riff and amazing soloing over an up-tempo jazz-rock Latin tinged shuffle…later cut by Airto’s vocal and percussion showmanship …but resumed, until the climaxing end of this fascinating album
