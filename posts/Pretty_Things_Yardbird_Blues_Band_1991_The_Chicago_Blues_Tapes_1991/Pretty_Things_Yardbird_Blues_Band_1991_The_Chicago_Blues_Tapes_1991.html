   Take a Studebaker add a couple of Pretty Things, a drop of YardBird, a little Canned Heat and throw in some Chicago Southside Sisters and you get Chicago Blues with a strong under currant of English flavor.

   On this disc, vocalist Phil May and guitarist Dick Taylor of the English band the Pretty Things got together in 1991 with Yardbird drummer Jim McCarty, Canned Heat bassist Richard Hite and Chicago's Studebaker John on rhythm guitar for a rockin' night of raw blues. The band doesn't perform anything new on the disc, sticking to covers of Bo Diddley, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed and others. But the performance is nothing short of excellent. The vocals of Phil May are top notch and Taylor's guitar screams and cries like he was born and lived his entire life in the blues club of Chicago. The backgound beat of McCarty's drums are locked tightly with Hite's base and compliments Studebakers guitar and harp to form an almost perfect back drop from which May and Taylor work their magic. If, and that's a big if, there is a weak spot on this disc, it would have to be "Time Is On My Side" which just doesn't quite seem to fit with the rest of the tracks. Overall, it's raw, totally unrefined and in everyway near perfect.

   This set, attributed to the Pretty Things-Yardbird Blues Band, is really more Pretty Things (thanks to strong vocal work by Phil May and some striking lead guitar from Dick Taylor, the two cornerstones of the Pretty Things) than the Yardbirds (although former Yardbirds drummer Jim McCarty is on hand), and it doesn’t add much to the legacy of either band, really, although it is a strikingly good outing. The tracks collected here originated when May and Taylor teamed up with McCarty and guitarist and blue harpist Studebaker John and bassist Richard Hite for two George Paulus-produced albums recorded in Chicago in 1991. The sound is very good, and these weren’t throwaway sessions, with the blended band tackling classic songs like “Spoonful,” “You Can’t Judge a Book by the Cover,” “Time Is on My Side” (Taylor was briefly a guitarist for the Rolling Stones early in that group’s career), “Ain’t Got You,” and “Chain of Fools,” among others. Again, nothing here adds much to the legacy of either the Pretty Things or the Yardbirds, but fans of either or both bands will undoubtedly love this interesting curio.
