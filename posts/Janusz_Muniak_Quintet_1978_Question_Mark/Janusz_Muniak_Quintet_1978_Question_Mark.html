   This is the debut album as a leader by the great Polish saxophonist / composer Janusz Muniak, one of the forefathers of modern Polish Jazz. His legacy includes the membership in such legendary Polish ensembles as those led by Andrzej Trzaskowski, Krzysztof Komeda and Tomasz Stanko as well as leading his own groups. He is accompanied here by his quintet, which includes pianist Pawel Perlinski, guitarist Marek Blizinski, bassist Andrzej Dechnik and drummer Jerzy Bezucha, all excellent players themselves. Muniak has a completely unique, natural style of improvisation, which is passionate and highly expressive, putting him somewhat aside in a class of his own besides the other distinguished Polish saxophonists, like Zbigniew Namyslowski for example. His compositions incorporate beautifully Polish folklore and the Jazz tradition, often unintentionally, but always brilliantly. This is on of the strongest albums in the legendary Polish Jazz series, which is a very high distinction by any standard. This is a must to lovers of Polish and Eastern-European Jazz and a timeless masterpiece.
