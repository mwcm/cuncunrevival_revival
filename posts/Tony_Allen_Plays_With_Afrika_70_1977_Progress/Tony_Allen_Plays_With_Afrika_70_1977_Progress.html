   Tony Allen was without question one of the world's greatest drummers. As the rhythmic backbone of Fela Kuti's legendary Afrika 70 group, Allen's contribution to Afrobeat, and music in general, was essential. He was to Fela what Elvin Jones was to John Coltrane! His pivotal drumming style combined elements of traditional African, R&amp;B/funk, and jazz polyrhythms to forge a truly revolutionary and distinctive sound. As a long time member of Fela's group, he was also high profile enough to make his own albums as a leader with Afrika 70, two of which are included here. "Jealousy," with its B-side "Hustler," and "Progress," with its B-side "Afro Disco Beat," have all the trademarks of classic Afrobeat -- pulsating march-like grooves, layered percussion, and great, catchy horn riffs. The only thing missing is Fela's booming baritone vocals. With facsimiles of the original cover art and an essay by esteemed Fela biographer Michael Veal, this is a most necessary purchase for Fela devotees. If you picked up all the Fela MCA reissues as I have (if you haven't, hurry up they are starting to go OOP), and you can't get enough Afrika 70, then this disc is for you.
