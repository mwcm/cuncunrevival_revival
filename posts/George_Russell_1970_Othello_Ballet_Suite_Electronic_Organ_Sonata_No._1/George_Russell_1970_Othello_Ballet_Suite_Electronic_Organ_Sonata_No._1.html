  George Russell's stepping quite far out from his earlier work here – recording in Scandinavia in the late 60s, with some very trippy effects! The album is dominated by the two-part "Othello Ballet Suite"– recorded in Stockholm in 1967 with a group that includes Rolf Ericksson on trumpet, Bertn Rosengren on tenor, and Arne Domnerus on alto – and the sound is a mixture of relatively free and out playing, with a few passages that snap into more of a swinging approach. The "Electronic Organ Sonata No 1" was recorded in Oslo in 1968, and features Russell improvising on the organ of a church. It's a very strange number – but one with a wonderful otherworldly feel!
