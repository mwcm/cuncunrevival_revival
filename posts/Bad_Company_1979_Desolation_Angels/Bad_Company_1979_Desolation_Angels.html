   After the critical and relative commercial failure of 'Burnin Sky' Bad Company took a year off from recording and reassembled at Ridge Farm in Surrey during the winter of 1978 to record what became 'Desolation Angels'. Named after the Jack Kerouac novel it was a massive return to form putting them right back into the higher reaches of both the singles and album chart.

   Gone is the muddy muffled sound of the previous album and the laziness of 'Run With The Pack'. This is hard hitting blues based rock at its finest. A natural successor to 'Straight Shooter' and the blueprint for the more melodious bands of NWOBHM and the early 80s rock revival. This is what early Whitesnake and the chart friendly version of Rainbow became in the following year. It has punch, power, hooks, melody, light, shade, blues, hard hitting rock and even female backing singers.

   From the outset Desolation Angels has the foot tapping, the head nodding and it is just a real feel good type of album. From the octave divider guitar riff of opening track 'Rock n Roll Fantasy' to the dying soulful note of 'She Brings Me Love' there is not an off note, a missed key or a wasted second anywhere. Mick Ralphs is playing at his fastest and heaviest proving once and for all that he is woefully underestimated as a rock guitarist. Despite the overall power of the album he still manages to play some nice soft acoustic lines in the self penned 'Take The Time' and 'Crazy Circles'. Some funky laid back country twang on 'Oh Atlanta' and some great understated tasteful guitar on 'She Brings Me Love' as well as some straighforward blues on 'Early In The Morning'. Simon Kirke and Boz Burrell are so tight throughout it is impossible to fault them and Paul Rodgers is ...... well ..... just Paul Rodgers ..... enough said.

   Beautifully balanced throughout Desolation Angels showcases a band of multi talented musicians playing at the height of their creative careers with a new found hunger and enthusiasm that had been sadly lacking just a year earlier. The heavy crunch of 'Rock n Roll Fantasy', 'Lonely For Your Love', 'Rhythm Machine' and 'Gone Gone Gone' are all perfectly countered with the softer 'Take The Time' and 'Crazy Circles'. Whilst the blues of 'Early In The Morning' and the laid back soul vibe of 'She Brings Me Love' the two longest tracks, compliment the western flavoured 'Evil Wind' and the country stomp that is 'Oh Atlanta' like a fine wine accompanies a great dish. Leaving you with a forty minute feast of pure aural delight.

   Whisper this quietly for my reputation may not survive but this is my favourite Bad Company album. I like it even more than the debut, and not just because it was my first Bad Co album either. A rock classic and a must listen for any serious lover of rock music. Oh and just to top it off a great cover by Hipgnosis !
