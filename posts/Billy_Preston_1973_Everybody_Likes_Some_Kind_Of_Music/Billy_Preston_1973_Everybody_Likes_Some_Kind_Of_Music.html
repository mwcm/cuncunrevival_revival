   Billy Preston loved all kinds of music. His solo albums usually represented this ecclectic taste, but his most ambitious and varied offering came in the shape of his 1973 LP 'Everybody Likes Some Kind of Music'. Preston taps into a slew of styles, and the end-result is pretty remarkable.

   The up-tempo soulful rocker "You're So Unique" stomps on nicely and is followed by the Big Band/Swing cocktail number "How Long Has the Train Been Gone".

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Foot-tapping country church revivalism explodes from the raucous "My Soul Is a Witness", whereas the deceptively titled "Sunday Morning" actually rides a traditional country rhythm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "You've Got Me for Company" puts emphasis on melody, and is a gorgeous mid-tempo ballad with a nifty string arrangement, while the equally pensive "Listen to the Wind" is more of a Leon Russell-styled swamp rock excursion.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The follow-up to his hit "Outa Space" is here as well: "Space Race" follows the same pattern as its high charting predecessor, a monster funk instrumental featuring Billy's trademark, oozing synth solos.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Back to basic blues is here too, in the guise of the harmonica-heavy "Do You Love Me?" which also stars a fatback horn section and, less orthodox, a huge string chart. "I'm So Tired", on the other hand, is quintessential early '70s funk rock Billy Preston style: a gutbucket groove laden with horns, gospel piano and swirling, oscillating synth wails.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Before closing procedures with the classical (!) "Minuet for Me", Preston turns in a funked-up rendition of the Bob Dylan classic "It's Alright Ma".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A pot-pourri of styles, to be sure, but nonetheless the experiments mostly work.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On Everybody Likes Some Kind of Music, Billy Preston attempted to put together a sound as wide-ranging as the album title. The jazzy "How Long Has This Train Been Gone?" is clearly patterned after classic show tunes, while "My Soul Is a Witness" is a straight-ahead gospel song, complete with a choir. Add to that the country of "Sunday Morning," the '70s soul of "I'm So Tired," and the funky instrumental "Space Race," one of Preston's most enduring classics, and the result is a wildly diverse album. That doesn't necessarily mean, however, that it's a completely successful one. Because most of the experiments are so short (barely clocking in at two or three minutes), they don't really register as complete songs, the way the longer soul and funk tracks do. That's not to say that Preston is a dilettante, since each of the genre tracks are well-performed and carefully produced. It's just that Preston should have chosen one or two genres to experiment with and composed fully developed songs, since he clearly has the talent to do so. The funk and soul tunes are excellent, much more thought-out and constructed, and are what make the album worth listening to. Everybody Likes Some Kind of Music is well-performed and solidly produced, but with some more focused songwriting, could have been an impressive set. As it stands, it's an interesting, but flawed collection.
