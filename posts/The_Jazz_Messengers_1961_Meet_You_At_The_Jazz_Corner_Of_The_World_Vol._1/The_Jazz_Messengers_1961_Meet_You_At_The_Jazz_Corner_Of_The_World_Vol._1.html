   The legendary NYC jazz club Birdland was sacred ground for drummer Art Blakey who recorded three live albums for Blue Note at the venue between 1954 and 1960: A Night at Birdland, At the Jazz Corner of the World, and Meet You At The Jazz Corner of the World. This last date featured one of the greatest lineups of Blakey’s powerhouse outfit The Jazz Messengers. Spirits are high on this superb outing from the iconic introduction by MC Pee Wee Marquette through two volumes of thrilling hard-bop.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There are three indispensable 2-disc sets recorded at Birdland and released under Art Blakey's name. The first, "A Night at Birdland," deserves the listener's first consideration for several reasons: it's a historic first, the first "live" recording of significance by Blue Note and Van Gelder; it includes the special arranging and accompanying talents of Horace Silver; it's one of the two or three most distinguished recordings by the brilliant trumpeter, Clifford Brown who, despite never seeing his 26 birthday, is ranked by those who should know as "the best of all time." But neither of the two remaining double-disc albums recorded by Art at Birdland should be considered a distant second. Both "A Night at Birdland" and the brilliant Columbia studio album, "Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers," combined the arranging/accompanying genius of Horace Silver with the enabling, inflammatory energies of Blakey to produce albums as noteworthy for their solo work as for their ingeniuous, swinging arrangements. However, when Silver split from Blakey to form the Horace Silver Quintet, the differences between the two groups could not have been clearer. Whereas Horace's groups, especially after the spectacular success of a minor Silver tune ("Song for My Father"), stressed formulaic arrangements with contained solos (even with the prodigious Michael Brecker on board), Art's groups were about individual freedom and maximum self-expression while adhering to the jazz mainstream. The seemingly indefatigable, indestructible leader seemed to share with the American poet Ezra Pound the criteria: "Make it new!""Make it live!""Keep it alive." All the while, Art could be heard hollering encouragement ("Play your horn!") and cracking his whip relentlessly to ensure that not so much as a single lifeless, sterile moment would threaten vital, creative stream. "Play every note as if your life depended on it" was his motto, spoken by a drummer who, despite all that might be said about Buddy, Max. Elvin and Tony, was in a league of his own, unequalled in terms of sheer power. He was thunder and lightning personified, a force of nature, and all attempts to emulate him--alumni bands that attempt to perform the Messengers repertory--fall way short because there was only one Bu.

   For this reason, Art's on-location albums are his best, the ones that are most likely to return a lifetime of inexhaustible pleasure to their owner. The later two Birdland albums have an undeniable edge in the saxophone department. Some listeners may prefer the pictured album, "Meet You at the Jazz Corner of the World," because of the presence of Wayne Shorter; others may prefer the almost identically worded "At the Jazz Corner of the World" because of the ceaselessly inventive, soulful playing of Hank Mobley. But both sessions are equally valuable; both will reward the listener with new, exciting discoveries with each new listening. Both albums, moreover, serve to do full justice by the skills of trumpeter Lee Morgan, providing him with the kind of platform Clifford Brown enjoyed on the first of the Messengers' live albums from Birdland. And at least one other live Messengers album rises to the same indispensable level: "At the Cafe Bohemia," another "two-fer" that includes not only Horace Silver but the redoubtable Doug Watkins on bass, the profoundly melodic tenor of Hank Mobley, and the trumpeter who replaced Clifford Brown in group he had co-led with drummer Max Roach: Kenny Dorham.

   Some collectors, no doubt, will disagree about the distinctive excellence of Mobley who, despite (or because of) being the most-recorded Blue Note tenor player, was all but taken for granted. And when he served as the primary transitional tenor player between Trane and Shorter in Miles' quintet, he was made to look bad on the Columbia recording ("Someday My Price Will Come") on which Miles' decision to include Coltrane on the title tune could only make Hank appear the simpler, markedly inferior player. But to my ears Mobley brings to the music an understated, unfaltering lyricism that simply refuses to wear out its welcome. Perhaps even more than another underrated and understated tenor "giant" of this period, Harold Land, Mobley is a perpetual source of surprise and delight, a player who embodies the African-American tradition that James Baldwin expresses so movingly in what some regard as the best story about jazz, "Sonny's Blues."

   The prices I'm seeing for this two-fer are slightly out-of-sight. Consider picking up a used edition of Volume 1 and downloading Volume 2 (though I'd pay the freight for the complete "At the Jazz Corner" as well as "At the Cafe Bohemia" and "At Birdland." (I'm content to go with my analog LP edition of the popular "Moanin'" session, which to my ears runs out of steam more quickly than "Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers" on Columbia, a desert-island disc if there ever was one (which is not to deny the merit of the Golson compositions on the "Moanin'" disc that have since become jazz standards).

   [Warning: Since acquiring the Van Gelder remastered CD of "Meet You at the Jazz Corner of the World," I've come to the realization that some of the distortion I formerly blamed on a commercial downloading service is in the original source. The mics and/or mixing are simply overly "hot"--to the point that occasionally the tones break up.] As for the music, Lecuona's "The Breeze and I" may be a lovely melody, but it's highly questionable whether the tune is worthy of this ensemble. When it comes to Blakey and company, you can put aside cool breezes as well as escapist fantasies like "cool jazz,""contemporary jazz,""smooth jazz" or any other musical pleasantries, whether dated or new age. Blakey's music is lighning and thunder, it's bold and in your face, the story of joy born of suffering and pain, its music containing the history of a people yet universal in its appeal to our deepest understandings of what it means to be human.

   Blakey's last name is one letter away from the most visionary poet in English literature: William Blake. Blake called his best-known poems "songs," and none of those songs is more admired than the one capturing the power of the Tiger and questioning its source. It's doubtful that any writer--critic, admirer, novelist, poet--has tapped into the creative well-springs of an artist like Art Blakey as persuasively as William Blake does in "The Tiger":

   What the hammer? what the chain?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   In what furnace was thy brain?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   What the anvil? what dread grasp
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   When the stars threw down their spears,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   And watered heaven with their tears,
  </div>

   Did he smile his work to see?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   In the forests of the night,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   What immortal hand or eye
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
