   As the title implies, this McCoy Tyner release is a low-key, after-hours affair. Far removed from the intensity of work with then-boss John Coltrane, Tyner stretches out on a fine mix of standards and bebop classics. The pianist, of course, always had his own fleet and rich way with ballads, in spite of the galvanizing marathon solos he became known for on live dates and his later experimental recordings with Coltrane. His ballad style is even touched with a bit of sentimentality, which thankfully is kept in check by a bevy of tasteful lines. Backed by the topnotch rhythm tandem of bassist Steve Davis and drummer Lex Humphries, Tyner finds the room to develop classic statements on highlights like Monk's "'Round Midnight," Ellington and Strayhorn's "Satin Doll," and Parker's "Star Eyes." On more easeful tracks like "For Heaven's Sake," Tyner utilizes his block chord approach to meditative and romantic effect. Rounded out by solid blues sides like "Blue Monk" and Tyner's own "Groove Waltz," Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues qualifies as one of the pianist's most enjoyable early discs.

   Pianist McCoy Tyner is best known for being a member of the John Coltrane Quartet beginning in 1960. During those years, Tyner re-invented the piano as a highly percussive, stirring instrument that churned the waters for Coltrane's abstraction and expanded spiritual solos. For some strange reason, in late 1962 and the first half of 1963, Tyner was asked by producer Bob Thiele to record more straightforward jazz albums as a leader. These albums included Reaching Fourth, Today and Tomorrow, and McCoy Tyner Plays Duke Ellington. But the finest of these straightforward piano recordings was Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues.

   Perhaps Thiele overheard Tyner playing standards in the studio one day and decided to record him. Or perhaps he felt that Impulse would be best served if Tyner could play two roles for the label—agent provocateur for Coltrane and elegant trio leader for the older, more relaxed set. Recorded in March 1963, Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues featured Tyner with bassist Steve Davis and drummer Lex Humphries. They were perfectly matched.

   Tyner's playing is exciting and exceptional on all of the tracks: Satin Doll, We'll Be Together Again, 'Round Midnight, For Heaven's Sake, Star Eyes, Blue Monk, Groove Waltz and Days of Wine and Roses. On the album, he exhibits a reserved elegance and tenderness that reveals the other side of his personality—a lover of melody and standards. In this regard, there are traces of Oscar Peterson in his playing. Perhaps Thiele was using Tyner to take a bite out of Peterson's vast and successful early-'60s share of the jazz market.

   But Tyner's passion for modal jazz and the avant-garde seeps through in fascinating places, addition a modern flavor to many of the songs. Unfortunately, we learn little about Thiele's motive or Tyner's decision to record the album from the unsigned liner notes. What is revealing, however, are Coltrane's impressions:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Tenor saxophonist John Coltrane has pinned down the characteristics that have given Tyner this ability to reach an ever-widening public—'melodic inventiveness' and 'clarity of ideas.' Coltrane has also pointed out the basic reason Tyner is and has been important to the world of avant-garde jazz: 'He gets a personal sound from his instrument; and because of the clusters he uses and the way he voices them, that sound is brighter than what would normally be expected from most of the chord patterns he plays.'"

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Perfect coffee table albums, often from artists from which this kind of music was not entirely expected.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   McCoy Tyner's Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues is such an album: it's polished, it's slick, it's above all extremely elegant and stylish, and it has really very little in common with the music that Tyner recorded at the time with John Coltrane, or indeed with anything that he recorded later for Blue Note or Milestone.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Satin Doll" is Ellingtonian to the extreme; "Round Midnight" is bar jazz at its most sophisticated, and the other tracks fit in seamlessly into this set of classy jazz standards. This is not a bad thing at all; it's just surprising to hear Tyner in this context. Unlike the later  McCoy Tyner Plays Ellington, which seems both forced and bland, Nights of Ballads &amp; Blues sparkles and is enjoyable from start to finish. It may not be Tyner's most advanced recording (in fact, it is probably anything but), but it's certainly good fun.
