   Based in Houston, Texas and originally known as The Bloontz All Star Blues Band, the group featured the talents of drummer Tony Braunagel, singer Andy Chapman, lead guitarist David Kealey, keyboardist Mike Montgomery, and former Blackwell bassist Terry Wilson.  They relocated to New York in 1972 and shortened their name to Bloontz, scoring a contract with the Evolution label.  Produced by Ron Johnsen, 1973's cleverly-titled "Bloontz" wasn't half bad.  Mind you, none of the nine tracks was going to win an award for originality, but in the AOR genre the songs (with three of the five members contributing material), were quite varied and the performances were virtually all enjoyable.  As lead singer Chapman had a voice that was near perfect for album oriented rockers - tough, rugged, but quite commercial.  Imagine Paul Rodgers had he been born and raised in Texas.  The rest of the band were also quite good with guitarist Kealey deserving special notice for his tasteful solos.

   There is a huge connection between this next hard rock band “Bloontz” and “Kiss”. Apart from playing together in the early 70's, some members of “Bloontz” were credited on the ‘Lyn Christopher’ album with Gene Simmons.Bloontz was comprised of Tony Braunagel (drums), Andy Chapman (vocals), David Kealey (guitars), Michael Montgomery (keyboards), and Terry Wilson (bass, guitar) and had originally been brought from Houston, Texas to New York City by producer Ron Johnsen. The lead singer of the band was also a good friend of Robbie Leff who would write parts of the music to the Patti Dahlstrom song “Weddin’” which was recorded on the Lyn Christopher album with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley on backing vocals. Like KISS, it is likely that Bloontz’s involvement in the library benefit was a result of Ron Johnsen who lived next door to the benefit’s organizer. Three of the members of Bloontz, Michael Montgomery, Tony Braunagel, and Terry Wilson were session players on the Lyn Christopher. Since the three are credited as appearing courtesy of Evolution Records on the album’s rear credits it is likely that their album came out prior to Lyn’s or was at least being recorded during the same time period.

   Backing vocalists on the “Bloontz” album would include Margaret Dorn, Linda Lawley, Sharon Redd, and Zenobia. The first three of these vocalists would also sing backing vocals with Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley on the Lyn Christopher album. Naturally, Ron Johnsen is the other connection having produced Wicked Lester’s album and managed KISS during part of their early career. Both the Bloontz and Lyn Christopher albums were recorded at Electric Lady Studios. Bloontz didn’t make it as an act and three of the members (Terry, Michael, and Tony) teamed up with ex-Free guitarist Paul Kossoff in Back Street Crawler who competed with the other ex-Free member’s band Bad Company. Back Street Crawler had also included John “Rabbit” Bundrick who had been in a band, Blackwell, with Terry Wilson, and who replaced Montgomery on keyboards following the release of the band’s first album. They had released a self-titled album in 1970. The band released two albums, “The Band Plays On” and “Second Street” prior to Kossoff’s death.
