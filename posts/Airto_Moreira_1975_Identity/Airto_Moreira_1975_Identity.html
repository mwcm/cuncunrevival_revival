   Anyone who hasn’t yet understood the vital role Airto played as one of the main architects of what gave a good name to early 70s Fusion as a movement that sought to enlarge horizons by incorporating as many elements of what makes music such an universal language as possible , how he contributed to transversely help hundreds of musicians rediscover the ancestral roots of what they played, and why everyone from  Miles to McLaughlin, to Santana, to Paul Simon, to Joni Mitchell to a horde of Blue Note Jazz-men, you name them, wanted to have his African or South-American jungle instincts coloring and assisting them in shaping and defining their sounds, should check the man’s identity card, of which this album is a comprehensive and fascinating synthesis.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is also the fruit of a solid partnership and an undeniable artistic empathy with Egberto Gismonti who co-authors four out of the seven pieces and who is along with Airto a fundamental pillar in the making of this masterpiece, contributing with his dazzling multi-instrumentalist chops, switching from acoustic to electric piano to the ARP Odyssey the String ensemble and the Pro-soloist synthesizers to wooden flutes and to the acoustic guitar he’s best known for;

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album’s Magic spell starts being revealed right on from the initial spires, on the brisk hallucinatory ritual of “The Magicians” by the seemingly wildly strummed guitars and hammered piano , incantatory flute phrases , spiraling gut-string single note runs and slithery synth fill-ins atop a percussive frenzy and lead by Airto clamoring and warm vocals, or with beautiful unisons with Flora Purim throughout unpredictable changes and stellar organic arrangements as on the dramatic, syncopated and impassioned “Encounter”.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   David Amaro injects his blistering electric guitar vocabulary against the Funky slapped bass of Louis Johnson (other bass players on the album are John Heard and John Williams) on the infectious sections of “Tales From Home”, after delicate percussions and scintillating Rhodes introduce a piece that uncannily contrasts the differences between Airto and Flora recitations of the same theme,  and then again against a bubbling bass on the closing “Flora on my Mind”, a moving paean to an often announced love that would fully materialize, a piece that counts with a fiery trombone solo by Raul de Souza and which, as on other occasions,  feeds on awesome working of the rhythms tensions, either with chopped off or suspended grooves that demand a resolution and create an on-the-edge feel rarely experienced elsewhere.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The title track is a percussions-only retour to the jungle with the support of Airto’s percussion’s department assistant Roberto (most probably Robertinho Silva), where as the only concession to outside writing is an homage to the great Hermeto Pascoal with a spiritual reading of his “Mãe Cambina” atop ethereal Rhodes arpeggios , ornamented by chirping birds emulations and a middle part when berimbau and double-bass briefly install a waving pulsation, before the initial fervent theme capable of bringing tears to one’s eyes resumes.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And then there’s the stirring and anthemic “Wake up Song”, with its Epic trombone launched arrangement, where producer Herbie Hancock contributes with a blistering synth solo, and which counts with a cameo appearance of Wayne Shorter whose soaring soprano lines respond to Airto calls and vocal pirouettes.

   If I could only take a handful of Brazilian albums in that famed desert island, this one would surely be among them.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With some of Airto's usual suspects including Hugo Fatturuso on keyboards, David Amaro on guitar, the ever beautiful and magicical Flora Purim, and Raul de Soza on trombone settling in with American musicians like Herbie Hancock of course, John Heard and John Williams playing their asses off on bass, and even Louis Johnson from Brother's Johnson playin' slap .. think he might have been only 19 or 20 years old at the time .. topped off with the true musical genius of Egberto Gismonti on keyboards and guitar, these guys put together some truly powerful and moving music. Magic .. really. Not an overly long recording by total time, it nonetheless holds up to the test of time.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For me, there are passages that transcend superior musicians simply playing great. Like many of Hendrix's early recordings, for me, these songs have an undefinable magic that moves me as much as any music anytime anywhere.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As an extra note, check out Egberto's piano and guitar .. all I can say is wow! This guy is on another planet .. like Airto, like Hendrix .. beautiful powerful emotion with licks like none other. Hope you enjoy.
