   Alan Silva has pulled together all the guys who were recording for BYG at the time and has put on a live performance of what was probably his crowning achievement, a piece called “Seasons”. This is an incredibly avant-garde piece, but an unusually good one. As there is a lot of players on here, the freeform sound is always full and solid, and never does that really uncomfortable thing were one instrument just goes-it-alone for twenty minutes and becomes a real headache. Unlike a lot of freeform work this is not musical masturbation.  This is a very orchestral sounding piece that is much more contemporary free classical as opposed to free jazz. It’s an amazing thing to sit through, but there are some major downsides. There are six sides to this album, and they are long sides too, approximately twenty five minutes a side. So to listen to this piece you are going to have to commit yourself for roughly two and a half hours. Now I love to sit down and listen to music for long stretches, but I like to vary the stuff I’m listening to. I mean, two and a half hours of one artist, on top of which it's two and a half hours of one piece, well to be honest that is just not going to be something I want to put myself through that often. So you see what I mean by being really impractical.

   However, this is one of the most beautifully packaged albums I’ve got. I love the BYG covers anyway, but it’s just really nice the way they’ve got it as a triple vinyl fold-out. Plus it’s all that 180 gram vinyl, so it’s a seriously solid package. Get Back have done an amazing job with all these BYG reissues, and they’re all great value too. Unfortunately the stuff that was recorded for BYG was just a little too free for my tastes, and even though I will probably never listen to this album again, I’m glad, in all it’s solid glory, it’s sitting in my collection.

   An immense soundscape, originally released on triple LP, with well over two hours of engaging avant garde music. In contrast to the impenetrable cloud of noise that Silva's Luna Surface is, Seasons leaves much more spaces for the individual musicians, so that what evolves here is a rich, varied and engaging texture that often feels more akin to contemporary classical than jazz; except of course when all hell breaks loose and the unrestrained free improvisations are unleashed upon the listener. It's a majestic, thrilling, and above all intense experience that has been referred to as a "radical bombardment" of sounds.

   Don't let the miserable packaging of the reissue on CD deter you from purchasing this remarkable gargantuan effort by bassist and composer Alan Silva, for which the term "masterpiece" is not too far a stretch. The original three-LP set has been compacted to two full-length CDs. Unfortunately, there are no liner notes, and you may need a magnifying glass to decipher the list of more than 20 participating musicians, who read like a who's who of avant-garde jazz at the time this was recorded. As there are no individual tracks and the "composition" is more than two hours long, there is also reproduced from the LP a detailed time log listing the instruments at any particular moment. Unfortunately, the log is virtually useless as it corresponds to the six sides of the original LPs. That aside, this is a magnificent, rambling, chaotic, lavish, and often meandering spectacle that should be heard in one sitting to be completely appreciated. It takes the concept of "sheets of sound" to the next level. Even with its deficiencies, it is a spectacular presentation, with snippets of melodies (or more precisely, riffs) interspersed among the soloists, who include Silva, Steve Lacy, Lester Bowie, Joseph Jarman, Roscoe Mitchell, Robin Kenyatta, Michel Portal, and Joachim Kühn, to cite the more recognizable names. The results are absolutely thrilling, if not always inspiring, and there are many high points. While individual improvisers are difficult to identify, the level of improvisation remains consistently at the highest levels. It is wild and free, and the listener receptive to free improvisation is likely to be held in rapturous attention. Destined to be a classic of its genre, Seasons offers a full-scale radical bombardment from many perspectives, resulting in a smorgasbord of delights. While listening to so much at once is a challenge, the patient listener willing to put in the effort should be fulfilled and rewarded amply.
