    Don "Jake" Jacoby was a noted trumpeter, teacher, band leader and author who died December 25, 1992 at age 72. He played with Benny Goodman, Les Brown, did session work for CBS, NBC and soloed at Carnegie Hall. In addition, he did much recording session work in Dallas, Texas, where he also performed with his own groups and served for a while as president of A.F. of M. Local 147.

   <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Jacoby was born in York, Pennsylvania and learned to play trumpet from an uncle at six years old. He was one of the youngest players ever accepted to the famous E. S. Williams school. While still in his teens he often played the Herbert L. Clarke parts in the John Philip Sousa band in concerts in Central Park.

    Jacoby spent much of his life teaching and doing clinics for Conn. During this time he recorded several albums such as "Have Conns Will Travel", "Don Jacoby &amp; College All-Stars Swinging Big Sound LP" and "Jacoby Brings The House Down".
   </div>
   <div style="text-align: justify;">
    He spent the last years of his life teaching private students and writing a trumpet book, "Jake's Method". Don taught in Denton, Texas, and tutored many very successful brass players including Bobby Shew, Marvin Stamm, Craig Johnson and Dan Miller.

   <div style="text-align: justify;">
    He was listed as one of the top players of the 20th century in Dr. Nobel's book, “The Psychology of Cornet &amp; Trumpet Playing," and he is mentioned in "The Secret of Technique Preservation" written by his teacher E. S. Williams.

    The record cover comes from Alex Steinweiss (who is considered the inventor of this art form) and shows a massive swinging wrecking ball on which the many big band musicians are stylized. And the music is as massive as a wrecking ball. Don Jacoby, a trumpet teacher from Pennsylvania, gathered young, talented jazz musicians from renowned music colleges around him in 1962 and recorded a record with 16 big band standards for Decca. Five trumpets, four trombones, five saxophones and a four-piece rhythm section ensure a rich sound. Master Jacoby wrote all the arrangements and blew all the trumpet solos himself. Musically, the "Collage All Stars" are hardly inferior to the teacher. It all sounds extremely mature and swings so confidently, as if you didn't have 17-26 year old youngsters on the instruments but the traditional NDR big band with an average age of 53.7 years. The tracks are mostly kept at a brisk pace - only a few pieces in between have a calmer, more sedate character (e.g. "Young Man With The Blues", "Just For A Thrill" or "Let Me Love You"). So mostly the sonic wrecking ball prevails (typically: "Groovin 'High"). For a long time this is not only very impressive, but also extremely thrilling. In the long run of the whole record, however, this sound gets a little on my nerves because big band music doesn’t vary that much according to its character. You can't listen to the disc quite often in a row, but big band music is (possibly) just as suitable as a Nirvana record for relieving stress in between.

    Most of the "College All Stars" were hardly heard from in later years, except perhaps from Dee Barton, who composed some film scores, from the drummer John von Ohlen, a member of several better known jazz groups, or from John Giordano, the conductor and became a music professor. By far the most impressive later career, however, was the 17-year-old pianist of the College All Stars, a student at the Berklee School of Music. The piano hardly really comes into its own in this brass-heavy music. You rarely hear some nice runs, for example in "Young Man With The Blues" or in "You Don't Know What Love Is", a classic that the pianist enjoyed interpreting years later with his "own" jazz trio .
