   "There is much interest in his records. Because of that, I am well taken care of."

  <div style="text-align: center;">
   -Alan Douglas, as quoted in Ebony, 1988.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For roughly twenty years, producer Alan Douglas possessed total control over the Hendrix catalog. Under his stewardship, Jimi's recordings were seen as fodder for sales rather than inviolable relics of a man who passed too soon. While some of the Alan Douglas releases involved dishonest overdubs and rampant edits, others were sabotaged by more subtle forms of tampering. As these nefarious misdeeds came to light, they were amply derided by Jimi's loyal fanbase. After defeating the old scrooge in court, the Hendrix family sought to undo the damage wrought during his shameful tenure. The official history has basically written him and his records out of the grand Jimi Hendrix narrative. But now I shall, in the just spirit of Procopius, unveil a chapter from the secret history of these dark ages.

   In the mid-70s, Alan Douglas made two "fake" Hendrix albums using mediocre leftovers and loads of overdubs. In the 80s, he focused on editing material rather than adding onto it. Nine to the Universe shows his penchant for cutting down the jams into more digestible pieces. This 1987 compact disc is another example of the new Douglas approach. Rather than giving us a full concert, he has elaborated a Frankenstenian "best of" from a three night JHE stint in San Francisco. All of the music on this CD has undergone some state of the art 1980s digital tweezing and remixing. Oh sure, the live performances at the Winterland are absolutely wonderful vintage 68 Experience barnstormers, but the sound quality has been debased by the producer's prerogative. Notice the digital reverb on Mitch Mitchel's drums, the unreal distance between the instruments, the inaudible bass of Noel Redding and the acceptable but hardly ear-shattering work of Jimi Hendrix. It's the Alan Douglas way: edit and remix and make it hip 'n modern. If you compare this to the Eddie Kramer-supervised live fare released from the late 90s on, you will see a tremendous difference. The straightforward Kramer material is in your face rather than timid and tinny. Nevertheless, this Alan Douglas-sanctioned compilation remained the only non-bootleg to shed light on the Winterland shows for almost two decades. And so, until Experience Hendrix opted to bring the music out from the haze of 1980s remastering, the world had to be content with this out of print relic.
