  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A few years ago, I had this debate with a seller at a record fair. I mentioned that I was looking for Chet Baker records, whereupon he wanted to sell me a Gerry Mulligan/Chet Baker 10" at a ridiculously high price, insisting that these were some of Baker's best recordings. I, however, was looking for Baker records from the 1980s, insisting that those were his best recordings. "Best recordings?" the seller sneered, "he couldn't even breathe properly anymore in the 1980s".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The point being that if you like pre-1955 Chet Baker, you'll most probably not like any of his later recordings. Pre-1955 Chet Baker is prime "cool" jazz, white, mathematical West Coast jazz, some swing, lots of brain, and no guts. Oddly enough, as it is not just the time of his highest popularity in the USA, but also the period most readily available on compact disc (thanks to EMI owning the rights to the Pacific Jazz catalogue), the first three years of his career have -- very unjustly -- become almost synonymous with Baker's entire oeuvre.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This very aggressively priced and impeccably mastered 4-CD set contains the complete recordings of Gerry Mulligan with Chet Baker from the early 1950s; even though it says "quartet" on the box,  it not just contains all the recordings of the famous piano-less quartet, but also a few live sessions including larger ensembles.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Quite frankly, I much prefer Baker's recordings post-1956, after he had discovered hard bop during his extended stay in Europe and abandoned cool jazz. Mulligans's compositions are not without their merit, but rather than feeling the music, he seems to be constantly solving mathematical equations while playing his tunes. Sometimes the much more simplistic and straightforward Baker sounds almost refreshing compared to Mulligan's convoluted, but ultimately heartless runs, but even Baker was still pretty far from his later emotionality. Only a few exceptions, such as the heartfelt first recording of "My Funny Valentine" (still one of the very best) offer a glimpse at what Baker and Mulligan would have been capable of had their music been less brainy.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Also included in this collection, and very refreshing in comparison, is a session with Lee Konitz also released as Konitz Meets Mulligan. Despite being something of a cool jazzer himself, Konitz sounds far more natural and less mathematic than Mulligan, and provides some much-needed fresh air.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is of course a vital collection for fans of cool jazz. If you're into early Gerry Mulligan, there's no cheaper, more complete set of his recordings than this. However, if you are more into late Chet Baker as I am, you may be able to acknowledge this collection for its historical value, but you may find it somewhat lacking, and unless you are a completist, a "Best of Mulligan/Baker" compilation might also be sufficient.
