  Thee Image were formed in 1973 by former Blues Image, Iron Butterfly and Cactus guitarist Mike Pinera and keyboard player Duane Hitchings, formerly with Buddy Miles. Pinera’s first band, Blues Image scored a US hit with the single "Ride Captain Ride” and had begun life as the house band of a Miami rock club called Thee Image. Pinera’s skill as a guitarist meant he was a much in demand musician. After a spell in a reformed line-up of the hard rock group Cactus in 1973, Pinera formed Thee Image with Duane Hitchings on keyboards and talented drummer Donny Vosburgh (who had also played with Blues Image). The band was signed to Manticore in 1974 by Mario Medius who had known Mike Pinera from his time at Atlantic Records in New York whilst he was a member of Iron Butterfly.

  Thee Image recorded their self-titled debut album at Criteria studios in Miami, producing a work of polished and sophisticated rock. Although "Thee Image” failed to chart, sales were encouraging enough for Manticore to continue to support the band with the recording of their next album, "Inside the Triangle” in 1975, albeit with a release in the USA only.
