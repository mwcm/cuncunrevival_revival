    In that one play we have a Hard with influences of Blues, made with a strong kitchen, powerful guitars, aggressive vocals and torn. The result is an addictive sound something that will bands like Cactus, Led Zeppelin and Faces.

   <div style="text-align: justify;">
    All the tracks on their sole album were penned by Yeager and demonstrate the band’s skill and their sense of humour: Jesus People, Dirty Sheets, Dirty Old Man, Let’s Make Love are just some highlights of a very consistent album. Still working with Michael Stevens, Atlee Yeager would go on to issue another album on Chelsea in 1973

    "Flying a Head" is good 70's guitar oriented hard rock. It won't blow you away but is a nice listen. Vocals are a little too much and the piano is just ok, but the quitar saves the day. Another one of those "one and done" groups from that time and space.
