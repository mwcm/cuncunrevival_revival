   These days, John Handy is known mostly for his superb solo on the studio version of "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" by Charles Mingus. In the 1960s, however, Handy was one of the standouts in a large class of all-star reed players (John Coltrane, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Charles Lloyd, Eric Dolphy, Pharaoh Sanders, Dewey Redman, Wayne Shorter), whose collective recorded legacy continues to stagger and amaze curious listeners (like myself) to this day. Handy has led several memorable ensembles, but the one that's featured here is especially strong. He and violinist Michael White are always thinking ahead, yet their solos come across so perfectly constructed, you'd swear they were composed. The rhythm section of guitarist Jerry Hahn, bassist Don Thompson, and drummer Terry Clarke create an almost oceanic tide of tension and release. Their music dances out of the speakers. It'll take you to places you'll long to return again. And again. And again. As an aside, their followup album, confusing titled "The 2nd John Handy Album," is equally brilliant (and equally hard to find). Long live John Handy!

   Was Frank Zappa in attendance for this concert!?  I mean this was 1965 and the music had guitar, violin, drums, bass and saxophone.  Four years later, Zappa would release Hot Rats with guitar, drums, saxophone, violin, bass and a sprinkling of other things.  Not only is the lineup similar, but the second half of the 27 minute trip, "If Only We Knew", sounds a hell of a lot like it could have been on "Hot Rats".  The first half sees each musician have an opportunity to be play all by themselves.  In the second song, "The Spanish Lady", you can hear the strong influence that Charles Mingus had on John Handy's saxophone playing when he played with him for about a decade.  Once again, despite the slow start, the music slowly spirals into Hot Rats madness, except in a latin-jazz-fusion kind of way.  FUNKY.  This will add nicely to a pile of extremely unique music that I have to lend people.  An album with Mingus influence, that influenced Frank Zappa:  too damn freaking cool.  This was re-release as "Live at the Monterey Jazz Festival" in 1996.
