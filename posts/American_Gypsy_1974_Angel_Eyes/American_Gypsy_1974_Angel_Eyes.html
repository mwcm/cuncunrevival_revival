   Since 1963, this funk group of American origin has performed under diverse names such as Blue Morning, Orpheus and Pasadena Ghetto Orchestra. American Gypsy began club performances in Los Angeles in 1971, followed by a two-year tour of Spain. When the group settled in Amsterdam, The Netherlands in the early 70's, the line-up was: Joe Skeete (bass guitar), Michael Hamane (lead guitar), Lorenzo Mills (vocals), Richard James aka Ricardo James (drums), David Harrell (vocals, guitar, sax, flute) and Steve Clisby (vocals, keyboards). During their American period, individual members recorded sessions with many popular artists: Barry White, The Byrds, Young Rascals, Frank Zappa, Jefferson Airplane, Dr. John and Santana.

   They continued live club performances throughout Europe and was one of the more popular r&amp;b/rock acts on the club circuit during that time.

   Funk group of American origin who came to the Netherlands in 1972, and recorded their first album "Angel Eyes” on Philips (Netherland) in 1974. The same year, the same album issued on “Ariola” german label with a different cover. The year after in 1975, the same album (2nd pressing) issued with the title “American Gypsy” and its black cover on btm records. Great soul funk album including the killer tune “Inside out”, in the vein of the UK tune “Talking About Love” by FBI.

   Besides, you can find an album named “American Gypsy”, by the band Gypsy on CBS label in 1970. But there is no relation between these both groups……~

   The band’s actually got an interesting, if somewhat torturous history. Formed in the early-1960s, over the next decade the group went through a series of name, personnel and genre changes, including Blue Morning, Orpheus, and The Pasadena Ghetto Orchestra (love that last name). They managed to pay their bills as sessions players, supporting a wide array of acts ranging from The Byrds to Barry White.

   Frustrated with their inability to break on their own, in 1972 the group (with a line up consisting of singer Steve Clisby, guitarists Michael Hamane and Dale Harrel Jr., drummer Richard James, percussionist Lorezo Mills, and bassist Joe Skeete), decided to abandon the US music scene and take a stab at success in Europe. Avoiding the UK they opted to take up residence in Limburg, Holland where they caught the attention of manager/producers Piet Souer and Hans van Hemert who proved instrumental in getting them signed to Philips (Ariola signing them to a German distribution agreement).

   Released in 1974, the band debuted with the single 'Angel Eyes’ b/w 'Let Your Life Be Led By Love’ (Philips catalog number 6012435). A mix of Sly Stoned-psych and disco stomper the single proved a surprise hit. As was standard marketing procedure, Philips rushed the band into the studio to record a supporting LP - the cleverly-titled “Angel Eyes”. Picking up on the band’s success, Chess jumped in signing on as the band’s US distributor. Who knows why, but for the domestic market Chess elected

   Co-produced by Souer and van Hemert, their 1975 album debut “American Gypsy” was a diverse and somewhat enigmatic enterprise. With most of the band and producers Souer and van Hemert contributing material, the album bounced all over the musical spectrum. As lead singer Clisby had a chameleon-like voice capable of mimicking everyone from classic love man crooner ('10,000 Miles’) to whacked out Sly Stone ('Lady Eleanor’). The latter had to be the strangest cover of a Lindisfarne song you’ll ever hear and was actually a Dutch hit. The diversity factor may have been unsettling but made for album that was also a lot of fun to play 'spot-the-influence’ with. The lead off rocker 'Inside Out’ recalled a blend of Sly Stone funk and Barrett Whitfield produced psychedelic-era Temptations. Written by van Hemert 'Ooh Why Not’ sounded like first-rate Brit pop - imagine a Chapman-Chinn production with Beach Boys harmonies attached. 'Golden Ring’ was conventional old school soul, before breaking into a jazzy scat propelled ending. There was even a pretty cool synthesizer-driven progressive instrumental - the closer 'Tribute To American Gypsy’ ! Not the year’s most original offering, but fun through and through. For the US market Chess also tapped the LP for a single in the form of 'Angel Eyes’ b/w '10,000 Miles’ (Chess catalog number CH-2170). Both the single and the parent LP went nowhere effectively spelling the end to their US recording career. ….bad cat….~
