  An odd little album with Ashley's strangely hypnotic monotone reciting a text above an accompaniment of tablas and keyboards. I never really got a clear sense of what the text was about, but I don't really think that's all that necessary in this case. The instrumental background is as hypnotic as Ashley's voice with an unceasing tabla and simple progressions played on keyboards, mostly on a Polymoog. The overall effect is a static mix of three fairly distinct timbres which don't really seem as if they should work together, but somehow do. I wasn't so sure at the start, but withing 3 or 4 minutes I'd been successfully sucked on in.

  On each side of this record, the composer reads an abstract prose fiction over "settings for piano and orchestra by `Blue' Gene Tyranny," and that's it. The vocal style is a kind of hypnotic singsong; the quiet settings are dominated by piano, tabla, and what sounds like a string synthesizer. I like it more than Discreet Music, less than Another Green World, and about as much as A Rainbow in Curved Air. I suppose I prefer side one, "The Park," because I like the verbal content more, although in fact I perceive the reading as music, just like I'm supposed to, and have never managed to follow the words all the way through. A friend who's done yoga to this record--not an arty type, incidentally--is reminded of going to sleep as a child with adults talking in the next room. Then again, a rather more avant-garde friend who made me turn it off is reminded of the spoilsport who used to read the rosary for five minutes just before his favorite radio program
