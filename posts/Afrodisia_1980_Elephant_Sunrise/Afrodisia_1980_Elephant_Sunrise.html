   A combination of US soldiers with local musicians from Worms, Germany, Afrodisia. 'Elephant Sunrise' has become a collectors item because every song's a winner! The music spans soul to funk to disco and jazz with great ease.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Rare work from a funky group who really lead with their basslines and love their rhythms – so much so that vocals are often an afterthought when it comes to the grooves! These guys are German, but they've got a righteous sound that really lives up to the flavor of the cover – and we're guessing that the combo is one of those unique hybrids of American and European players on the overall scene – working with wickedly tight sounds on the bass and drums, dosed throughout with jazzy keyboard solos, tenor sax riffs, and lots of funky guitar.

   The band's leader Darnell Summers is originally from Detroit and is the brother of Headhunter Bill Summers who also features on the album as a player and songwriter. 'Sugar Free' is highly regarded by aficionados on the soul scene for it's glowing summer sounds and is one of the two songs that Bill Summers co-wrote on the album. This is one album not to be missed!
