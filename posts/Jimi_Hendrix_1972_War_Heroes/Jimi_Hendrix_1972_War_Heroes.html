   Jimi Hendrix left behind more unreleased material than just about any other rock artist. Some tracks have rated as all-time classics ("Angel,""Izabella,""Drifting," etc.), while others should have remained in the vaults (such as the full-length albums Crash Landing and Voodoo Soup, two collections that were near-criminally touched up by then-Hendrix keeper Alan Douglas). The out of print War Heroes is one of the few consistent compilations of unreleased Hendrix, and has since been replaced by First Rays of the New Rising Sun and South Saturn Delta. Highlights include "Beginning" (which contains a riff almost identical to the Stones'"Bitch"), "Highway Chile," and "Izabella," a track premiered on a Dick Cavett TV show a year before Hendrix's death. However, not all of the material is up to snuff, such as the nonsensical "Three Little Bears" and "Midnight," an overtly indulgent instrumental. If you're a newcomer to Hendrix, don't start here, but if you're a serious fan searching for some interesting obscurities, War Heroes is definitely worth the price.

   I actually like this album a lot. Most of it is studio jamming. Some of it sounds like complete songs. But on all of it, Jimi Hendrix was in excellent form on his guitar. Some of it (as in Peter Gunn, where the jam falls apart, and the band then breaks into Catastrophe, and 3 Little Bears ) gets a little silly, but these are studio leftovers, so some lapses are expected.

   Especially impressive is Beginning, a somewhat proggy piece with shifting motifs, with Jimi deftly switching between rhythm and lead lines without missing a beat. So it's not the most polished Hendrix album, but I like to hear his guitar in the raw.
