  1, 2, 3, 5 were recorded live at High Chaparral, Chicago
  <br/>
  4 was found on the original master tapes for "THE AWAKENING" album
  <br/>
  6 taken from Scarab Records 45rpm / B side: "Freedom Road"
  <br/>
  5 - Derf Reklaw Raheem and Black Herman does not appear in this version of "Drum Suite". While still an incredible find, The Pharaohs would like you to know that this was just a dry run with the tape rolling. We have chosen to include it here for documentary purposes only.

   In The Basement is compiled of live tracks, b sides and a track that never got used for the Awakening album. These guys made a fantastic noise, whether it is the hard driving funk of "In The Basement", the Sun Ra infused groove of "People Make The World Go Round" or the heartfelt soul of "African Roots" -  all righteous stuff. Unfortunately there's the crazy inclusion of a ten plus minute drum jam. This I do not get at all. It's not like they had a shortage of material, the CD had one more track than the album, an instrumental take on Al Green's "Love &amp; Happiness". Why not put that track on here and have the drum tune as the CD only bonus track. I don't want to be ungrateful to Luv N' Haight for re-introducing this incredible lost band to the world, but ten minutes of drumming for me is just excruciatingly dull. Five out of five for the music, but taking into consideration the drum tune this album unfortunately doesn't get the top marks it deserves.

   The Pharaohs only managed one release during their short lifetime, 1971's masterful Awakening. But when the San Francisco-based jazz-funk reissue label Luv N Haight reissued Awakening in 1996, they also came out with a brand-new CD of mostly previously unreleased material called In the Basement. Most of this album was recorded live in 1972, after the already enormous 11-piece band had grown to include four more players, including a sixth drummer. The live tracks are fascinating, because where Awakening sounds like an earthier and more Afrocentric version of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (which several members of the Pharaohs would go on to found in 1973), the much loopier and more jazz-oriented tracks here sound more like Sun Ra jamming with the P-Funk All Stars. The 11-minute take on the Stylistics'"People Make the World Go Round" is absolutely indescribable, a mix of otherworldly horns and psychedelic guitars over a non-stop African-style groove. Other highlights include the all-rhythm "Drum Suite," a hypnotic blend of organic polyrhythms and chanting, and a stunning cover of Al Green's "Love and Happiness" that's the only studio track here. Not quite as wonderful as Awakening, In the Basement nonetheless makes one wish that the Pharaohs had lasted longer, just to see what would have happened next.
