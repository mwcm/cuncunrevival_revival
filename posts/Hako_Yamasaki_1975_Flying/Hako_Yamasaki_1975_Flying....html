   Hako Yamasaki didn’t have a lasting commercial career in Japan, but she did leave behind some of the best forlorn and depressing pop songs from the Japan’s 1970s music scene. Hako had one of those haunting, lingering voices that works its way into the musical arrangements of her songs.

   I am a little surprised that the New-Weird America crowd has not picked up on her psychedelic tinged tunes the way they have other artists from the same period. I have no doubt that she had an influence on the Japanese scene that would develop decades later (I first learned of her existence from a record store clerk in Tokyo, who was kind enough to show me some unsung Japanese artists), and hopefully a rediscovering of her music will take place.

   Ah, I have a weak spot for old Japanese (surprise surprise) pop...

   Something along the lines of Morita Doji, but not quite like her. Don't get me wrong they are both great singers but they differ in voice characteristics a lot. For example Moritas voice is soft while Hakos voice is much more passionate and determined but they are both rooted in melancholic sound in their songs (atleast it sounds like that to me). Musically is also awesome. It has everything 70s music needs (those famous rock organs (if they are called like that :o), electric guitars etc.) but there are also songs that are just acoustic guitars and Hakos lovely desperate voice.
