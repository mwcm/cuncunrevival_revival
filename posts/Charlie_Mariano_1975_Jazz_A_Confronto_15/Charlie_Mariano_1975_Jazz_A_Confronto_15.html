   Jac's Group“ featuring Charlie Mariano? Actually the complete Pork Pie band offers some unheard and very nice material here. I guess a contract with the MPS label could have been the reason for the irritating spontanous name change and the shortening „Jac's Group“ could stand for „Jazz a Confronto's Group“. Further i guess Pork Pie played a concert at the jazz club „Music Inn“ in Rome in early January 1975, where producer Aldo Sinesio, founder of the Horo label, asked them to make a separate recording in the Titania Studios Rome for his „Jazz a Confronto“ series.

   This often was the way to a record with him and Massimo Di Cicco did a good job as recording engineer. Aldo Sinesio was famous among the younger sceptical italian jazz musicians. The 70's had been difficult times for them to record what they genuinaly wanted and Sinesio offered them free expression in open atmosphere without any distrust of commercialization. And i guess Pork Pie's italian drummer Aldo Romano knew about that fact and so the door was open.

   The offered tracks are much jazzier than on Pork Pie's „official“ recordings, though sometimes meandering around the borders of the fusion genre. There is enough space for expressive solos by Jasper van't Hof, Charlie Mariano and Philip Catherine above the rhythmn carpet of Aldo Romano and J.F. Jenny Clark. I don't feel sure about if some tracks could have been out of Pork Pie's or individual players private program or could be improvised.

   The only track i'm sure about is van't Hof's composition „Zirkus“ that in fact is a version of „Neuteboom“ from the 1972 Association P.C. record „Sun Rotation“ (of course minus the studio trickery of Conny Plank). I'm very happy about the chance to listen to the „Zirkus“ version, because „Neuteboom“ is one of the tracks i love very much with the tricky 11/8 time signature and the swirling repetitive and mysterious unfinished character . And that crazy keyboard sound! It seems that van't Hof still hadn't finished it here in 1975, when Mariano starts to take part it sadly gradually fades out. Or even 1976 when listening to the end of Pork Pie's (The Door is Open) „Avoid the Year of the Monkey“ that still has a somehow similar structure in it's last minute.
