   This is his second and best known album The Poet. If there is any single tune that fits into the category ”best known pieces of Finnish jazz”, Olli Ahvenlahti’s Grandma’s Rocking Chair would be at the top of the list. The tune was first released in 1976. However, Grandma’s Rocking Chair did not gain a wider reputation until the early 1990s acid jazz boom when it was reissued in the Totally Wired 8 compilation and began to reach dance club audiences. The ‘third coming’ took place in 2001 when dj and house producer Kenny Dope released a remix of the tune. The fascination of Grandma’s Rocking Chair cannot be denied but, arguably, it could have been any other title from Ahvenlahti’s second solo album The Poet. Developing the style that was introduced in the author’s debut Bandstand, The Poet stands out as a landmark in its mixing of simple melody lines, modern jazz harmonies and cool rhythms.

   Olli Ahvenlahti's a poet on the keys – one of the most soulful players in the 70s Finland scene, heard here on one of his greatest albums ever! The record's got a glowing grace that's really wonderful – part CTI-inspired electric fusion, without as much jamming as other European work of the time – but also an album of rounder, warmer tones – recorded with a slightly larger lineup that includes Eero Koivistoinen on tenor sax, and lots of great percussion at the bottom! Tunes have a subdued approach to funky jazz – still tight in the rhythms, but with more of a focus on the nicely shaded horn solos, and on Olli's great use of electric piano and organ throughout.
