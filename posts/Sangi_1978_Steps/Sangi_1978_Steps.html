   Pseudonym of Italian guitarist and producer Maurizio Sangineto.''Steps'' (1978, SUN Records) was a balanced Fusion album, featuring Marco Marchetti on electric piano, Diego Olivieri on bass, Claudio "Cibi" Cibinel on drums and Enrico Borgo on Solina string with future Premiata Forneria Marconi violinist Lucio Fabbri guesting on keyboards.It starts from typical breezy Fusion as the centerpoint of Sangi's attempts and scans all related paths, including light Jazz Rock, Lounge Jazz and Funk, based on interesting guitar parts, mellow electric piano and atmospheric synthesizers.Unlike many similar albums, there is an emphasis on melodious and dreamy passages than technical excess or virtuosity, but it maybe goes too far to this direction, lacking serious dynamics and inspiration and becoming too easy-listening.A few tracks contain also sax and harmonica.The stunning ''Ricordi'' is without doubt the best instrumental track in here, no Funk or Lounge Jazz, just very good atmospheric Fusion with lovely guitar and synth moments, but too short to save the day.Sangineto later focused on the emerging fieldS of Pop and Disco Music, both as a producer and a performer.

   The Sangi album is a very pleasant fusion album, with a noticeable late 70s cruise ship / tropical feel. Exquisitely played and produced. As the AC says "I think part of the appeal of this one is the excellent sound quality, especially for such an obscure small label release. I doubt anyone could make an album that has quite this kind of production nowadays." And it's true. For such a small label private production, the rich full sound here is amazing...

   Finally, the AC notes "The other interesting thing is that there's a cameo appearance by Lucio Fabbri of PFM."
