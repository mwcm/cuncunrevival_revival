   This is an all instrumental treasure that's worth its weight in gold. Mr Lynn plays all manner of keyboards, including acoustic piano, organ, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Sequential Circuit Prophet 5, Mini-Moog, Hohner clavinet and the ancient Crewmar Brassman, along with the Rose Morris Westwood bass, the sound of which here is superbly delineated. Fine support is provided by Bob Jenkins on drums and Martin Ditcham on percussion. Had Rick Wakeman written and performed this, he would have been justifiably proud ~ it's better even than Six Wives in my book. If he's ever heard it, I'll bet he wish he had.

   Following the (quite long) storming opener, Another Good Reason, the album moves into more pastoral territory, but it isn't dull for a single moment. Rather, it really does capture the essence of a nearly forgotten summer, with many wonderfully evocative moments, moving to a brilliant climax with First Finale. Not to be overlooked, though, is the wonderful closer to (what was) Side 1, Grey Sky Blue(s), which rounds off in superb style the first half of a magnificently coherent album ~ a concept album, I suppose.

   Written, arranged and produced by Mr Lynn, the album was recorded at Millstream and Scorpio Sound and engineered by Nick Critchley and Dennis Weinrich, who also did the mixing, all in late 1980. Forgotten Summer was highly regarded at the time of its release and apparently gained him much work in the professional music world.

   Find Forgotten Summer and buy it. Your life will be enriched. 35 years on, I still love this album and play it regularly.
