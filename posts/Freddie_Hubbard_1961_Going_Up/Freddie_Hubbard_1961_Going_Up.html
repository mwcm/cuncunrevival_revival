   One of the most exciting trumpeters of all time, Freddie Hubbard ranked with Lee Morgan as the most vital trumpet player of the 1960s. Hubbard was a powerhouse from the beginning of his career. Goin' Up was only his second recording as a leader but it finds the 22-year old in blazing form, displaying brilliant technique, dazzling ideas, a memorable sound, and a vivid imagination.

   Matched with Hank Mobley and McCoy Tyner in a quintet, Hubbard frequently blows the roof off the Blue Note studios, whether playing originals by Mobley and Kenny Dorham or his own "Blues For Brenda." Some musicians take some time to become significant, but Freddie Hubbard was a giant from the start and the music he created on Goin' Up can rank with anything being recorded today.

   Hank Mobley lends a sweetness to the sax solos on Hubbard's second album that is beautifully countered by Freddie's forceful playing. If you're at all serious about hard bop, you should have all seven of his Blue Note albums. "Open Sesame" (his first) and this one act as an opening statement, showing an amazing mastery of styles for a 20-year-old, along with a stunning improvisational ability. This CD is currently out of print, so be patient and keep checking for better prices. If you only want one album by Hubbard, it should be "Open Sesame" or "Ready for Freddie". But once you have those you'll want the rest.

   A very good sophomore release from Hubbard, whose playing is beginning to mature

   Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's second outing on the Blue Note label was recorded in the Fall of 1960, and released in the summer of 1961 as "Goin' Up." Supporting Hubbard on this date are tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, pianist McCoy Tyner (returning from Hubbard's debut, "Open Sesame,") bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones.

   For the session, Hubbard requisitioned two compositions by his friend and fellow trumpeter Kenny Dorham. The first is "Asiatic Raes" which opens the album and was previously recorded by Dorham under the title "Lotus Blossom" on his 1960 Prestige release "Quiet Kenny." After a drum intro that hints at the syncopation of the melody, the rest of the quintet comes in for the catchy and uptempo head. Hubbard wastes no time in displaying his remarkable agility and range in his opening solo, with particular emphasis on the high register of his horn. The rest of the band gives spirited solo statements as well before they are back to the head and an interesting fade-out coda to end the tune. The second Dorham tune is "Karioka," also taken at a quick swing and Hubbard leading off the solos with some of his most lyrical soloing on the record.

   Mobley also contributes two original compositions to the session. The first is "The Changing Scene" a medium swinger in a funky minor mood that lends itself well to Mobley's big, blues-inflected sound. Hubbard simplifies in his solo and also sticks to the blues, with simple melodic ideas (that again tend toward the high register of the horn,) played with effective repetition and a deep swing. "A Peck a Sec" takes things back up to a brisk tempo, with a boppy head over rhythm changes with an altered bridge. The band sounds slightly challenged by the tempo and at times by Jones's tricky drumming, but both Hubbard and Mobley manage some nice moments in their solos.

   "I Wished I Knew" (not to be confused with the standard "I Wish I Knew") was composed by Hubbard's friend, saxophonist Billy Smith, and serves as the album's ballad. Hubbard shows off his lyrical side in his beautiful rendering of the melody, but another highlight of the track is the lovely and imaginative accompaniment by both Tyner and Chambers, who add the perfect flourishes in between the impeccable phrasing of Hubbard and Mobley. Hubbard's only original for the session, "Blues for Brenda, (dedicated to his wife) closes the album. It's a minor blues with a laid-back two feel for the head, though Hubbard spits some potent fire during his solo. Tyner also gives one of his more effective and memorable solos on the record, mixing long bop phrases, with more simple, melodic ideas that help steer the swing of the rhythm section.

   It's a strong sophomore effort from Hubbard that places emphasis on the great soloing abilities of Hubbard and the rest of the band. The material sticks mostly within the bounds of uptempo hard bop, but Hubbard adds nice, subtle twists to the arrangements that keep the music engaging. The record is easily recommendable to fans of the Blue Note-style hard bop, and will be of particular interest to those who prefer a quick tempo.
