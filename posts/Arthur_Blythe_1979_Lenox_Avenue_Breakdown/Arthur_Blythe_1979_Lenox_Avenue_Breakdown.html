   If you're unfamiliar with the music of "Black Arthur" Blythe (all I knew before hearing this was that he was a BEAST on Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition record), here's the pertinent information: first he was part of The Underground Musicians and Artists Association (the west coast equivalent of Chicago's AACM), then made his recording debut as a sideman for a 1969 Horace Tapscott record, then moved to New York in the mid 70s and spent a number of years playing with Chico Hamilton and Gil Evans. In other words, Blythe has already spent almost a decade working on his craft, and he's absorbed some pretty serious influences along the way. Blythe's alto sax sound has a vibrato you'd expect to hear from a tenor, though there's no mistaking it's an alto when he uses his full range during solos. For this album, he's put together a lovely combination of sounds - besides his alto, there's James Newton on flute, Bob Stewart on tuba, James "Blood" Ulmer on guitar, Cecil McBee on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Guillermo Franco on percussion. The arrangements are unremittingly creative and often unexpected. Everyone gels together extremely well on all four tunes, an impressive feat considering how varied the moods and textures are.

   "Down San Diego Way" starts things off on an unassuming note: a tribute to the music and people of the Southwest with feel-good melodies from sax and flute and a 'booty-shakin' groove. Enjoy it while it lasts, because nothing else comes close to being that light and happy again. The title track and "Odessa" are both of a more avant-garde nature ("Odessa" has an almost Middle Eastern feel) and "Slidin' Through" is a fantastic blues riff in 7/4. Heads are easily identified and not all that complicated, but with DeJohnette behind the kit and Franco complimenting him there's no telling where things will go. Ulmer probably makes the music more 'out' then it needs be, but only because his style is so free - when he comps he's producing strange altered chords and never in rhythm or in time with anyone else. It works though, and I heartily endorse the approach. Lenox Avenue Breakdown is a great performance from start to finish, plus where else can you hear tuba, flute and guitar all together in this kind of setting?

   Given the urban title of alto saxophonist Arthur Blythe's debut Columbia album, it's quite a shock when he and his red-hot band of collaborators that include James Blood Ulmer on guitar, Bob Stewart on tuba, flutist James Newton, bassist Cecil McBee, and Jack DeJohnette open with the decidedly funky Latin breaks on "Down San Diego Way." It's not a vamp and it's not a misleading intro, the first of four tracks showcases not only the deep versatility of the rhythm section, but Blythe's own gift as both a composer and as a soloist. He states the melody, handing off the harmonics to Ulmer and Newton and then flies high into the face of its chosen changes, allowing the beat to change under him several times before bringing back a theme and letting Ulmer solo. Blythe's grounding in the blues and in modal composition guide him on the title track; he and Newton move through intervallic shifts of chromatic intensity and spatial columnar structures, while Ulmer builds a middle bridge to both ground and fly from. But Blythe is not content here to showcase the extremes. On both "Slidin' Through," his exercise in harmolodic composition, and "Odessa," Blythe provides ample proof of his wisdom as a bandleader, encouraging solo and rhythmic interplay between different groups of musicians such as McBee and Blythe on the former and between himself, Newton and Ulmer on the latter as the rhythm section winds it out in both cases, stretching the narrow envelope into something far more textured and thematically unified -- note the Ornette-meets-noir ambience of "Odessa." This group lays like a band that had been together for years, not the weeklong period it took them to rehearse and create one of Blythe's masterpieces. Over 20 years later, Lenox Avenue Breakdown still sounds new and different and ranks among the three finest albums in his catalog.

   You could easily call this album a lost treasure, as it came and went after its 1979 release, not even seeing much light after bandleader Arthur Blythe and his six colleagues reached critical acclaim and success. Blythe counts this loose session as a paean to Harlem, where the assemblage of sounds and rhythms along Lenox Avenue translates into an amalgam not unlike the mix of James "Blood" Ulmer's funk-painted guitar strum backed by the twin engines of drummer Jack DeJohnette and percussionist Guillermo Franco, each of whom makes a sky-crying racket. They do so, surely, in a fit of inspiration, sitting as they are behind a potent frontline: Blythe on alto sax; James Newton on flute; and Bob Stewart on tuba. A tuba on the frontline? Well, in truth, these chaps are all playing the frontline, really. Newton's so revolutionary on the flute that his Rahsaan Roland Kirk-isms make for great rhythm, and his intricate Eric Dolphy-isms cut sharp harmony. Blythe takes his notes seriously as little living things, but his art is in the web work and the melodies. Stewart plays the chameleon, doing tempo a while and then showing slippery riffs galore to the band. Very little in jazz--much less major-label jazz, which this was--around 1979 could match this recording.
