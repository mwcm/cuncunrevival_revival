  Here's a something that whilst worthy of a listen is perhaps not the best place to start with this particular artist, it's uneven but nonetheless has a few great moments.
  <br/>
  Side 2 ,which is basically an accompaniment to Jayne Cortez's poetry conveys a fairly pervasive impression that this is indeed one of Thornton's weaker efforts.
  <br/>
  that impression being reinforced largely by the fact of the low budget/ very poor engineering... in all honesty it has to be said that this is flabby in comparison to most of the relatively few other Thornton albums... it'seasy to hear why it hasnt been reissued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Side one meanders a bit, though the recording quality is fine...and it does afford a glimpse of the great Karnatic master violinist L Shankar playing with Thornton and crew.
