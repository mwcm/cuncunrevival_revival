  Short-lived German Jazz-Rock act with a light proggy flavor.Syncrisis were located somewhere in South Germany and led by drummer Uwe Holzwarth, guitarist Titus Köstler, bassist Peter Frodi and keyboardist Edgar Müller.Their first album ''Reflections in Musical Power'' was recorded at the so called Syncrisis-Studios (reputedly Holzwarth's basement) and released in 1981 as a private press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The album is a very cool mix of fiery Prog/Fusion with tropical Jazz-Rock, always presented with a very positive and pleasant aura.The musicianship is all instrumental, including some superb guitar work by Köstler, somewhere between the styles of SANTANA and MARIO MILLO, filled with nice grooves and breezy solos.Edgar Müller, the man behind the keyboards, does a great job too.His electric piano lines have a strong CHICK COREA flavor, what are even more incredible are his breaking moog synths flights, which are really inspired.The rhythm section is quite strong as well and the album is characterized by the great number of interesting melodies, jazzy interplays and professional solos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While not adding anything new to the endless list of Jazz/Fusion acts worldwide, Syncrisis'''Reflections in Musical Power'' is an album full of nice surprises ans well-executed material, I think it definitely worths its money if a copy reaches your hands.Strongly recommended.
