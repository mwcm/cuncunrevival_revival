   The New York Art Quartet reflected the richness of the avant-garde. The spirit that spawned Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and Albert Ayler’s fire also produced the subtle, contemplative sound of the NYAQ (alto saxophonist John Tchicai, trombonist Roswell Rudd, drummer Milford Graves and 11 successive bassists). NYAQ lacked the shock value of those other innovators; add to that the lack of time, tonality or even solos-the band’s core was collective improvisation-and the music’s cool temperament makes it harder, not easier, to parse. Still, they were original, and nearly 50 years later remain stubbornly unique.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But if (as producer Ben Young suggests) they were “quietly revolutionary,” it was quite a minor revolution. The quartet existed from mid-1964 to late ’65, playing just over two dozen gigs and releasing two records during that span (a 1965 concert recording also appeared in 2010), and received slight attention. Yet the box set call it art features five LPs (four hours) of previously unreleased material, roughly triple the band’s lifetime output, and a 150-plus-page coffee-table book that gives them messianic treatment. At best, it’s of questionable necessity; realistically, it’s closer to ludicrous.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The packaging, it must be said, is splendid. Outside is a box of birch wood, naked save a sticker that bears the title and limited-edition copy number (of 665). Inside are five matte-sleeved pieces of 180-gram vinyl and a black, clothbound 11-by-11-inch book full of glossy pages and arresting color and black-and-white photographs. In producing a collector’s item, Young could hardly have done better: Collectors will drool.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The musical content is odds-and-ends stuff: a studio alternate take, concerts, loft sessions and one live radio broadcast on New York’s WBAI. Most of it is quite good, including a number of pieces that the NYAQ never otherwise recorded. The band shines: Graves is particularly brilliant as a frontline drummer with percussive color, while Rudd and Tchicai demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to each other’s sounds. Various versions of their best tunes, the trombonist’s “Banging on the White House Door” and “Old Stuff,” demonstrate their passion and delight with this music and betray a sizable Coleman influence. The excellent “Four Days in December” performance of New Year’s Eve 1964 (Records I and II) could have been an album in its own right. The set’s highlight, however, is Record II’s WBAI broadcast with Eddie Gomez on bass. Clearly an aircheck (albeit a high-quality one) with its light tape warp and too-high mic levels, it features Tchicai’s probing “Ballad Theta” and a fascinating abstraction of “Now’s the Time” along with three entrancing poems read by Amiri Baraka.

   The New York Art Quartet was a free jazz ensemble made up of saxophonist John Tchicai, trombonist Roswell Rudd, drummer Milford Graves and bassists Lewis Worrell and Reggie Workman, formed in 1964.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Approaching jazz from a wide scope, Afro-Danish American John Tchicai was a composer/saxophonist whose music is internationally known for its compelling sense of rhythm, drama and humor, its freedom, spirituality, healing qualities and ultimate freshness. He recorded with both John Coltrane ("Ascension") and John Lennon ("Life with Lions"), and he founded the ensemble "New York Art Quartet". John Tchicai was the first recipient of a lifetime grant for Jazz performance from the State of Denmark.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Roswell Rudd is a Grammy Award-nominated American jazz trombonist and composer. Although skilled in a variety of genres of jazz and other genres of music, he is known primarily for his work in free and avant-garde jazz.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Milford Graves is an American jazz drummer and percussionist, most noteworthy for his early avant-garde contributions in the early 1960s with Paul Bley and the New York Art Quartet. He is considered to be a free jazz pioneer, liberating the percussion from its timekeeping role. Graves has worked as a sideman and session musician with a variety of established jazz musicians throughout his career, including Don Pullen, Eddie Gomez, Andrew Cyrille, Rashied Ali, Kenny Clarke, Don Moye, Philly Joe Jones, John Zorn and Albert Ayler. He has invested his time in research within the field of healing through music.

   "Their music was fairly free, emotional, and quite notable for the trombone-alto frontline. The group was formed after Tchicai departed from The New York Contemporary Five, and the New York Art Quartet lasted until Rudd joined Archie Shepp's Quartet." - Scott Yanow, allmusic.com
