  After three fantastic albums such as LaVG, BB &amp; Offering, would LC manage to get one more under his belt? Unchanged line-up, still the usual Danny Weiss on the production stool, the main ingredients changing here would seem to be the return of wife Julie and the return of frequent singing from both spouses. Oh yeah, we get to see the ARP synth's first appearance, toyed by both LC and Mandel. Taking its name on a track from Barefoot Boy, and sporting an appropriate artwork, the album fails to pay homage to the BB track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indeed, TRGE is a sub-par album that ranges from almost country rock with brass/horns arrangements ala BS&amp;T as in the closing PF Sloan or semi Savoy Brown boogie of the title track, the only long song that allows a bit of an escape from basic song structures. Wife Julie signs two tracks, while hubby Larry signs four, the rest being covers, two of them from Jim Webb. The Scotland II track might just be the album's only "highlight" (if we can call it that), with the presence of the afore-mentioned ARP synth, but one can't say it is used that wisely, but at least it allows the track to blow over the tight structures of the songs present on this album, and give LC a bit of space to expand. But the break is not big enough to allow the escape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't get me wrong, not everything is bad on this album, there are moments of brilliance, the thing being that they are much fewer and farther apart.
