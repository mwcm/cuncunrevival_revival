  This is believed to be one of the LP's from the unreleased 12-LP Mothers box. This fake Bizarre boot LP is the best of all the bootlegged versions. It is not a mere knockoff of the earlier boot "Necessity Is...". It's from a different source and far superior sounding. All bootlegs of this unreleased LP have the sides reversed for some reason. I have presented them here in the correct order. Side B is early Zappa material, which has mostly been released on "The Lost Episodes" (though it has been heavily processed there). Side A was recorded in 1968-69 and parts have been released on "Mystery Disc", "YCDTOSA 5", "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" (CD Version) and "Ahead of Their Time". Tracks 06, 13, 16, 18 are totally unreleased. A few other tracks are extended edits with more material than the official release. Most of Side B is mono...the rest is true stereo. I don't think "Hey Nelda" is really a "bonus track" as it is listed on the Zappa Patio. I haven't seen any proof of that. It is from the same source as the songs that preceed it...not as though someone dubbed it from vinyl and tacked it on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Are the Mothers" is definitely the same as "Mothers at KPFK", no edits at all. "Right There" is the Mystery Disc version ["Skweezit Skweezit Skweezit"], with about 40 seconds of the Stage #5 version tacked on the end. "The Jelly", I am VERY sure, is the same as the last 2 or so minutes of "Didja Get Any Onya?" from Weasels Ripped My Flesh (only on the CD). I listened to both simultaneously and am convinced that it's the same performance. (If I'm right, this also would bear on [the bootleg] Apocrypha.) [It actually goes on for slightly longer - see below; Ed.] "Igor's Boogie" actually contains a large chunk of "King Kong" from Ahead of Their Time. From about 01:30 to about 05:00 in "Igor's Boogie", you get the blamph! that put an end to Motorhead's shenanigans at about 02:50 on Ahead of Their Time, then Bunk's or Ian's sax solo from around 04:30 to 07:00.

  Ronny and Kenny's booger stories on The Lost Episodes are both part of "The Story of Kenny &amp; Ronny. "Booger Freaks of America" is an interview between Zappa (I think it's Frank) and someone named Leonard:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  LEONARD: Well, it's an organization, the Booger Freaks of America, and I belong. It was started by a bunch of those fellows that found out that they couldn't kick their habit. And we'd find that no matter what we did, we'd - eventually, we'd turn to picking our nose and flipping it. That was a booger freak. A booger freak is someone that [inaudible]. I belong to that group.
  <br/>
  ZAPPA?: Leonard, I'd wish you'd tell us ...
  <br/>
  LEONARD: Yeah, man?
  <br/>
  ZAPPA: What are you doing to overcome this habit?
  <br/>
  LEONARD: Well, I ... this is my second time back in the BA, Booger Freaks of America. I, uh, I was out, I was clean, man. I had the mucus off my back. I was - I was really making it. I went to Hawaii and I was playing a couple gigs over there.
  <br/>
  ZAPPA?: Right.
  <br/>
  LEONARD: I just fell right back into it, man.
  <br/>
  ZAPPA?: What are your plans for the future, Leonard?
  <br/>
  LEONARD: 'Scuse me, I think I got a hold of one right now, baby ... wait a minute ... lemme get it ... got it now. You mind if I wipe it on your coat or something, man?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Igor's Boogie" is a live version, probably from the same show as "The Jelly". Most of side 2 has been officially released on the Lost Episodes: "Do It in C" is "Ronnie Sings?". "Opus 5" is a different edit here, starting 70-80 seconds before the official version and ending some 45 seconds earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This album has been bootlegged as Necessity Is ..., Rustic Protrusion and We Are the Mothers &amp; This Is What We Sound Like!. The bootleg versions have a bonus track: "Hey Nelda" by "Ned &amp; Nelda" - see Zappa's single discography for more info. Tracks 2-5 also appear as bonus tracks on a CD re-issue of the bootleg 'Tis the Season to Be Jelly and the Live USA re-issue of the bootleg The Ark - track 2, "This Is What We Sound Like", is listed there as "We Are the Mothers &amp; This Is What We Sound Like", even though the "We Are the Mothers" track is not included.)
