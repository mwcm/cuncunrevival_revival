   This is a real hidden gem from Pharoah Sanders’ back catalogue. This album was his first outing post Impulse, and it kind of seems to have become a bit neglected between all the majesty of his earlier Impulse recordings, and the latter return to form of his Theresa recordings.

   Musically: tracks one and three are long, mellow, haunting and incredibly vast and spacious; track two is a joyous uplifting tune with some vocals done by the man himself. There's not too much in the line of big bold statements, or out-there playing, the whole thing is evenly chilled and soulful across the entire recording. All the tunes are really great, and it is difficult to chose a high point, but the opening track "Harvest Time" has some of the most incredible floaty rhythm running through the first half and has a wonderful spacey quality to it. In all honesty though, the whole album is great, so high points are pretty redundant really.

   There's some negativity about this album on certain review sites which I really do not get, it is a soulful, joyous and atmospheric album that any Pharoah Sanders fan would be crazy to ignore.
