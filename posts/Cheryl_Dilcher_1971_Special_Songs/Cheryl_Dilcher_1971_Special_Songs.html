   Cheryl Dilcher began her musical career in her hometown of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Accompanying herself on the 12-string guitar, she played her self-penned songs at concerts on college campuses in the Lehigh Valley in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some of the colleges she played include Lafayette College (Easton), Lehigh University (Bethlehem), and Muhlenberg College (Allentown).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Cheryl played a weekly gig at a small coffeehouse, the Back Fence, in Greenwich Village. This club usually booked three acts a night, and the floor was littered with peanut shells.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1967, a self-styled record producer from Red Bank, New Jersey, Johnny Dee (John DeCesare), was looking for a musical act to manage, produce, and record. I lived in the same apartment complex as Johnny and met him and his mother through my mother. I played a left-handed 12-string guitar and he was intrigued. He recorded me on his home reel-to-reel recorder, trying to turn my folky style into R&amp;B by encouraging me to throw in some "baby, baby" to the Neil Diamond song, "Do It."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the time, he was also managing and promoting a rock band from Matawan, first known as Jay Walker and the Pedestrians but later changing their name to Hole in the Wall (after a restaurant they spotted in New York City). I started hanging with Johnny and the band, going to their local gigs and to the Vantone Sound Studios (14 Northfield Avenue) in West Orange, New Jersey where they cut a single, Sam Cooke's "Bring It On Home to Me" backed with the Rolling Stones'"Blue Turns to Grey." He got them a record deal with Epic, and hooked up with producer Jeff Barry. Johnny was headed for the big time with office space at 1650 Broadway, New York City.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Johnny trolled for talent in the New York City clubs and saw Cheryl perform at the Back Fence. He immediately thought she was his ticket to fame and fortune and convinced her to let him manage and record her. He made a demo acetate in 1969 of her singing her songs with her 12-string, and started planning for rehearsals with other musicians prior to recording an album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   By this time, I'd gotten married in February 1968 to a musician I'd met at Monmouth College, West Long Branch, New Jersey. Joe and I performed together locally and at "basket house" coffeehouses in Greenwich Village as the Joint Effort. Johnny sort of managed us but never put any effort into booking or recording us. He liked us and thought we could play and sing harmony on Cheryl's first album so he gave us the acetate to learn the songs.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I transcribed the lyrics and Joe figured out her chords, and we worked on them for several weeks, devising harmonies and finger-picking patterns to complement Cheryl's strumming guitar work. We met Cheryl for the first time at Smile Studios (763 8th Avenue, New York City) for the rehearsal. Joining us was Lane Emley, the lead guitarist from Hole in the Wall.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It soon became apparent that we didn't need two female 12-string rhythm guitarists, so I didn't play. Joe played the finger-picking he'd arranged but Cheryl didn't like it and Johnny decided he wanted more of a rock sound. I figured we'd at least get to do the background vocals.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Johnny, in his inimitable fashion, decided to record Cheryl with part of her boyfriend Wayne's band: Wayne Achey on drums; John Adelson on lead guitar, organ, and harmonica; Dave Wagner on bass guitar; and Amedeo Borsetti on electric piano and organ. Lane Emley played bass guitar also. The other players were studio musicians who Johnny hired.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For background vocals, he brought in a young woman who was gigging around the city, picking up studio work to supplement her regular night performing at the Continental Baths--Bette Midler. So, yeah, I can say I was replaced by Bette Midler!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Now that Cheryl had an album recorded, Johnny shopped it around to various labels. I'd been studying the music business for several years and recommended Elektra as a good fit. He decided to approach Ampex, the tape manufacturer, which was branching off into the recording business. Ampex released Special Songs in 1970. Two newbies trying to figure out how to market Cheryl.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Johnny wanted to meet with Cheryl on her home turf, so we three drove from New Jersey to Allentown, Pennsylvania, to her apartment with a beautiful bay window over a corner luncheonette (401-1/2 Gordon Street). We stayed at a hotel downtown and, because we didn't have much money, we brought along our camping stove and cooler and cooked dinner in the room all three of us shared.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Johnny, being weird, didn't want the hotel to know there were three people staying in one room, so he elected to sleep, fully clothed, on top of the second bed so it wouldn't look slept in. We slept under the covers in the other bed.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Cheryl lived with a roommate, Kelly, and she joined us at a local diner for lunch. We all got along pretty well and soon Joe and I were driving to Allentown without Johnny to Cheryl's for parties and to see her boyfriend's band play at a club in Quakertown.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In true hippie fashion, we slept on the floor in her apartment. One memorable weekend, people were smoking marijuana in the bathroom, sprawled in the dry clawfoot tub, while Kelly made sloppy joe sandwiches in the kitchen, and we musicians jammed in the living room. After one weekend party, we drove home the next day at 30 mph through a blinding snowstorm. The normally one hour drive took three hours crawling behind the snowplow. We had a lot of great times and only regretted that we weren't on the album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Joe has gone on to play delta blues locally and would love the opportunity to really provide some good slide guitar backing to any of Cheryl's efforts. He's actually started playing "Do I Have to Wait Very Long" as a regular song in his sets. Of all the songs on the first album, that one touches a place in him that resonates with his own experience and it is a valuable part of his nights on stage.

   It is so sad that she is now posthumely becoming a cult idol, I wished I would have found out about her 35 years earlier!
