   The Inner Mounting Flame was the first album which totally captured the power of hard rock and the freewheeling improvisational aspects of jazz. Larry Coryell, Miles Davis, and Tony Williams' Lifetime had tried something like this with some success in previous years. (It was no mistake McLaughlin was attached to all three of those efforts.) But none of that output captured the spirit like the Mahavishnu Orchestra's 1971 recording The Inner Mounting Flame.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Inner Mounting Flame 's ascending and descending distortion-laden mantra-like riffs and unison playing set a standard for jazz-rock that is still in place today. Its Indian influences merged with blues scales and rock rawness set the music world on fire. The musical attack was relentless.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Over thirty years after its release, this album can still blow away first time listeners. The Inner Mounting Flame was recorded before the use of synthesizers, drum machines, and computer enhancement. The sound is loud, raw, and dangerous. Wild abandon meets supreme musicianship on such classic tunes as "The Meeting of the Spirits," in which an introductory guitar passage sounds like an electric sitar played through a thick fog. A forbidding theme turns "The Dance of Maya" into a raving jazz-fusion hoedown. The drummer and bassist take a short rest while the acoustic guitar, piano and violin offer the beauty, grace and delicacy of "A Lotus On Irish Streams". How could this be the same band that just blew out my eardrums?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Melodies and rhythms like had never been heard before. The distortion and the loudness could be insulting, and the speed of the playing was mind-numbing. In short, this was the greatest jazz-fusion recording ever made.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Who were these guys anyway? John McLaughlin was an up and coming European jazz guitarist who recently had been best known for some far-out playing with Miles. Soon he would become a guitar god. Billy Cobham was an ex-marching band drummer from Panama who had played with the great Horace Silver and in the important band Dreams. He too would also take his rightful place in the heavens. Jan Hammer was a true innovator who would eventually achieve worldwide fame not only for his keyboard playing, but also for his movie and television scoring. Jerry Goodman was a jazz-folk violinist who had cut his teeth during the short run of the pseudo jazz-rock group The Flock. Rick Laird had been a musician friend John knew from London. He was the house bassist at Ronnie Scott's jazz club and had played with Ben Webster and Wes Montgomery. Although the Mahavishnu Orchestra enjoyed a relatively short reign, their influence still reverberates today.

   In 1972, the relatively unknown Mahavishnu Orchestra followed Count Basie at the Newport Jazz Festival. Upon hearing the very first ear splitting notes from the stage, hundreds of jazz fans—feeling musically assaulted - left the concert hall in a rush. What a joy it must have been!

   With Miles Davis, Tony Williams' Lifetime and Ian Carr's group Nucleus, jazz-rock took a definitive shape and started crystallizing to its actual form. Out of the Bitches Brew sessions came two bands that would really further define JR/F, the first being the brainchild of Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul called Weather Report, and the second being the pet project of John McLaughlin (and with Billy Cobham), called Mahavishnu Orchestra, based on the name his guru Chimnoy had given him. Both bands are simply the essence of jazz-rock and both were particularly progressive in their early days, before jazz-rock sort of veered to jazz-funk and later to fusion. With an almost impossible-to-improve line-up in terms of virtuosity, MO's first era was simply flawless, even if it sometimes went over the top and might seem today a bit indulgent.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Contrary to Weather Report (who reigned as a duo but allowed anyone to come up with numbers), MO was clearly John's ship and clearly he was the captain with no back up, coming up with all of the music, leaving no credits to others. Between his roles with Tony Williams' Lifetime and Miles' group, two albums became very much essential in understanding John's evolution: first came the fantastic Devotion, where his guitar playing simply came of age and his brand of jazz-rock was born with the help of Larry Young (ex-Lifetime) and Buddy Miles (ex-Hendrix), than came the acoustic My Goal's Beyond (where he meets Cobham and Goodman), where John opens up to a very wide spectrum, including Indian music. But these albums cannot lead anyone to guess what was coming with Inner Mounting Flame. Even three decades after my discovery of this album, I still refer to it as Inner Mounting Erection, because it never fails to arouse my interest and reach orgasm, at least aural. (Sorry, I just had to do it ;o)) So when TIMF came out, its impact on music took on seismic importance and they became an instant success, as this album was the perfect mix between jazz and rock.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Opening on the McLaughlin-defining Meeting Of The Spirits (a fantastic version of this emblematic piece) with John's eruptive solos flowing out like molten lava, fluid life a river and rapid like the thunder lightning, and the whole group accompanying him effortlessly, bringing the whole thing to an orgasmic big bang. The reflective Dawn, on the other hand, shows a very different and much quieter facet of this quintet, where Goodman's violin takes on the prime role as a soothing pill, even if McLaughlin's guitar manages to pull the track upbeat, before letting it drop to its original level. The aptly-titled Noonward Race is exactly that: a monstrous piece, a 300MPH track where Cobbham and McLaughlin let use see that they're not normal earthlings, then seeking to hide that fact, they are letting first Goodman and his violin, then Hammer's distinctive-sounding synth have their say, the track resembling a jam. Just like Dawn, the track Lotus On Irish Stream is gentle and soothing (after such a brutal Race), where McLaughlin's acoustic dexterity is featured, where Goodman's aerial violin borders the cheesy and Hammer's cool piano is the cement that binds the track.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The flipside starts with a machine gun fire, courtesy of Cobham, and Vital Transformation becomes the alter-ego of Meeting Of The Spirits, and echoes that track's greatness. Dance Of Maya breaks the cycle of hard-smooth rotation of tracks with a slow-developing blues (that transition from the intro to the track proper is one of the best I've heard) where Mc and Co unleash all they got in terms of histrionics, while respecting the format. The following You Know track seems to be a variant of Meeting, but a calmer one, just content to play with the original riff, Cobham twisting our heads with his fantastic drum rolls. The closing Awakening is a bit the alter-ego of Noonward Race, at least in its intro, but even when reaching its apex, its delivers inhumane speed activity that no police radar has been able to measure, even three decades down the line.

   How not to give this album anything but maximum ratings, without appearing a fool or having a chip on his shoulder?? This is the album that set the blueprint for so many groups to come, that its historical importance is worth maximum rating, let alone the musical near-perfection that it embodies. Blindly!!!!

   The word “fusion” is one of the most maligned in music, its status after the punk era eventually descending into the obscene for many people who consider themselves hip to good music. After years of hearing the soulless, overproduced bits of grocery shopping music best epitomized by the abortion known as Kenny G, it’s hard to blame them.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But this was not always the case. At the end of the sixties, musicians from both sides of the rock/jazz fence found themselves increasingly interested in finding a common ground, and albums such as Frank Zappa`s ``Hot Rats`` and virtually everything Miles Davis made from 1969 to 1975 contain some truly incredible music. One of the best (and, at least at first, most ``rock``) groups that defined this music was the Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by Davis protégé and guitar deity John McLaughlin, a man so humble as to never raise his voice on stage yet so aware of his own mystical status as a musician to christen himself ``Mahavishnu John McLaughlin``. There had been guitar superheroes before him, but dear old John was the first one to have a name that sounded like he’d stepped straight out of an issue of Doctor Strange.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   McLaughlin had shown himself to be a formidable guitarist on Davis albums like ``Bitches Brew`` and ``Tribute to Jack Johnson`` as well as his own solo albums, but it was on the Mahavishnu Orchestra’s first album ``The Inner Mounting Flame`` that the full extent of his abilities was shown. Honing his fingers to almost machine-like levels of speed and precision and fully embracing Marshall-stack fuelled volume, distortion and feedback, ``The Inner Mounting Flame`` contained some of the most aggressive guitar work ever heard up until that point. Even today, bedroom guitar-muso`s who can’t appreciate the blues-based dinosaurs of the hippy era might find themselves tipping their hat to McLaughlin’s magic fingers. Still, his skill would mean little if he didn’t have a group that could match him, so he set out finding similarly jazz-trained players who were ready to rock out. I’ve already compared McLaughlin to a superhero, so I might as well give the others the same treatment: On drums, Billy Cobham, a Panamanian drummer with the power of 10 Ginger Bakers! On bass, Rick Laird, solid as a rock and able to groove in any time signature! On violin, Jerry Goodman, formerly of the Flock and able to match McLaughlin’s stringed virtuosity! And on keyboards, Jan Hammer, master of the moog synthesizer and able to bend the notes of his keyboard! Together they are the mightiest fusion group ever assembled: The Mahavishnu Orchestra!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Although some would pick their follow up album ``Birds of Fire`` as their finest moment in the studio, for my money they never topped this debut, a monstrous slab of 8 instrumental bits of precisely controlled insanity and stunning virtuosity. Here, the sound is clear yet raw, with McLaughlin’s huge guitar tone growling and screaming at ungodly volumes, the production just clear enough for the listener to make out the (many) individual notes in his speedy runs. To my ears, McLaughlin’s guitar would never sound so good again, the bit of rawness only making his fret board pyrotechnics all the more exciting. And like most groups first albums, there is an incredible energy level here, an urgency and joy to the playing that only comes when a group of musicians first becomes giddily aware of their own potential. So enough back-story already, lets get to the music!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So begins the first track on the album, “Meeting of Spirits”, its dissonant first chord exploding out of the speakers. It’s as jarring as when your teacher would slam his ruler over your desk for talking in class, and the message is the same for both: shut the fuck up and pay attention! After a few more harsh but incredible blasts, the dynamics suddenly shift and the band quiets down, with McLaughlin introducing the main theme of the track, one that owes more to the pseudo Indian raga-rock freak-outs that psychedelic rock had been in love with for the past five years. McLaughlin’s, Goodman’s and Hammer’s instruments all swirl around each other, gradually building to a hurricane of sound before dropping the intensity again and starting anew. It’s exhilarating and highly indicative of the gigantic shifts in dynamics that will follow, not just within a single song but also between tracks, like how the relatively mellow “Dawn” and acoustic “Lotus on Irish Springs” sandwich the rampaging “Noonward Race”.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Another song that starts at full blast, “Noonward Race” is perhaps the most heavy metal any music tenuously connected to “jazz” ever got. Deciding that Hendrix’s “Machine Gun” wasn’t nearly an effective enough killing machine, McLaughlin’s guitar work here comes off as the aural equivalent of every war movie ever made, the chika-chika-chika of the main “riff” and speedfreak proto-shred of his guitar solo’s all played with maximum volume, maximum intensity and, of course, maximum speed. Anyone who’s ever heard bootlegs of the original group knows that this was almost always a highlight live, with band jamming on this song the hardest and longest in a set filled with 15-minute marathons of carpel tunnel musicianship.*
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Vital Transformation” is another killer in this vein, beginning with an astounding Billy Cobham drum intro that manages to be pretty funky despite the odd (9/8) time signature and lack of space in his groove. After about 15 seconds, the group tears into a ferocious unison riff that is the most memorable on the album, one that even denim jacketed headbangers-in training could get into. After a sudden and brief venture back into raga-style tension building, the band settles into a groove, and as always, McLaughlin’s solo absolutely kills, the band perfectly building to a frenzied climax with him.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Unlike many similar groups of the time, there are even a few moments on ``The Inner Mounting Flame`` that seem to hint that these boys had a sense of humour. Take for example ``Dance of the Maya``, a song whose wah-wahed pseudo horror movie introduction suddenly and inexplicably gives way to a post-modern blues shuffle (albeit one in 7/8 time). Or how “You Know, You Know” puts the listener in a mellow mood with its slow groove and lilting melody, only to periodically interrupt it with sudden stops and seemingly random blasts of odd chords. They may have let pretense get the better of them later, but here, it’s obvious the group was having fun.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The last track, “Awakening” ends the album on a frenzied and chaotic note. The shortest song on the album at 3 and a half minutes, one could argue that the group invented “punk jazz” before Jaco Pastorious thought of the term (or at least they could if it weren’t for the incredible amount of musicianship displayed within said frenzy). Comprised of a tremendous number of extreme moods and feelings, “The Inner Mounting Flame” must have been a daunting listen back in 1971, so much so that some parents probably begged their kids to take it down a notch and play some Led Zeppelin on their stereos.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Unfortunately, the group would only manage to release one more studio album and a live album before tensions within the band would cause them to implode. McLaughlin would gather many other musicians under the Mahavishnu name, but none of them would match the chemistry, power and sheer cosmic rush the first band achieved. So the next time one of your friends makes fun of you for liking “fusion”, do them a favour and blast them “The Inner Mounting Flame” as loud as you can…they’ll thank you for it.

    For the best of these, try searching for a boot of the group’s performance in Cleveland in 1972. It features a version of “Noonward Race” that will leave you completely exhausted and maybe a little confused by the end…and I mean that in the best way possible.
