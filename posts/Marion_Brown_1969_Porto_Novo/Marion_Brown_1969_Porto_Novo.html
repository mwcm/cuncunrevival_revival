   This was one of altoist Marion Brown's best recordings. Although a very adventurous improviser, Brown usually brought lyricism and a thoughtful (if unpredictable) approach to his music. Accompanied by bassist Maarten van Regteben Altena and drummer Han Bennink for this stimulating session (recorded in Holland), Brown stretches out on five of his compositions and is heard at the peak of his creative powers.

   While it may be overshadowed by the other Arista releases, Marion Brown’s Porto Novo is an excellent record, one which is nearly as appealing in its own way as the spectacular Ayler Vibrations. For while Brown was hardly one of the giants of the Sixties, his was and is a strongly individual voice, usually heard in tantalizingly small doses as a soloist, as on Coltrane’s Ascension or Shepp’s Fire Music, or even on some of his own records, like Afternoon of a Georgia Faun (ECM) and Why Not? (ESP). In view of Brown’s willingness to stand out of the spotlight, his forthright blowing on Porto Novo may surprise those who didn’t hear the original release of this material on Polydor. He certainly has the ability to fit, chameleon-like, into a variety of situations unlike some stronger voices who tend to play pretty much the same way regardless of the setting.

   The Porto Novo session actually left Brown no choice but to come up front and display his individual strengths to their fullest; not only because it is a trio date, but also because of the constant conceptual tension between Brown and Han Bennink who is caught fascinatingly midway between the derivative bebopper of Dolphy’s Last Date (1964) and the fully-armed genius of Topography of the Lungs (1970).

   The differences of style can be stated geographically. Bennink is a European drummer who has constructed, amazingly, an approach to percussion as convincing as any contemporary American stylist, but from his own sources. Brown, of course, is from Atlanta, Ga., and demonstrates a deep sense of his own roots in his playing. The contrasting approaches work together in interesting ways: a final balance is achieved even though at times the juxtaposition seems to underline the differences between the two men. Bassist Altena responds to the impulses from both sides and helps hold together a session that comes off beautifully for all the divergent ideas.

   Porto Novo is probably the most far reaching statement of Brown the altoist. All the aspects of his individual personality are revealed – what possibly impresses the most is the way Brown can move subtly from one kind of feeling to another yet hold it all together.

   The title track, for example, is both an exposition of the high humor of “Homecoming” from Why Hot? and the evocation of the natural world of which Georgia Faun is the ultimate statement. If you have enjoyed any of Brown’s playing on other records, you will want this.

   Well blow me down! Han Bennink is for sure one of the most creative drummers that jazz music has ever heard. This recording is centered more on the Brown/Bennink combination, and that works as good as the Cherry/Blackwell combination on Mu. I find a strong similarity between these recordings as Brown could appreciate retreating in order to let the other player speak in his own tongue, both Brown and Cherry had this special gift of staying silent without making it look like lack of inspiration. Brown had a very special, dizzying yet melodic way of knotting notes and lines in quite unexpected ways (his Solo Saxophone recording is also a very welcome addition), and on Improvisation he has no difficulty in showing his more frenetic, discordant improvisation procedure. The duet between Brown and Leo Smith on And Then They Danced is also noteworthy, and while the bass player did not shine at the level of Bennink (hell, how many can really keep up with such a machine gun?) and Brown, it is every bit as original as Quartet, Juba-Lee, Why Not, Sweet Earth Flying, Solo at Yale and Afternoon Of A Georgia Faun. Definitely recommended!
