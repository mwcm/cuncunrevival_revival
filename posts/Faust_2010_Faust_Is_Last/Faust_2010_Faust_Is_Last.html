  Wow! I almost forgot such kind of music could be played not from archive releases! Faust released 2 CD long album,full of fresh and energetic krautrock, deeply rooted in early 70-s, but with refreshed sound.
  <br/>
  Mostly instrumental album (still contains some vocals compositions) is noisy,ambient, repetitive in moments,psychedelic - but first of all its sound very fresh and never boring (what isn't easy for such long release with big amount of instrumental music)! First CD is a home for shorter almost instrumental only compositions with quite relaxed psychedelic improv sound, the second - longer and much noisier improvs with few different vocals, by its atmosphere (and sometimes even directly) similar to some early freaky Cpt.Beafheart's works.Strongest impression reminded after album's listening - I can hardly remember another release so filled with distorted instruments sounds! Yes, it's krautrock, and I didn't expected clear sounds, but level of distortion is over all my expectations! And it works - for sure it strongly depends on personal taste, but for me this music was a fresh air breath on nowadays experimental scene.It's great both 2 CDa are quite different between each other, but are important parts of the album - without any of them album wouldn't be the same for sure!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free jazz sax, ambient sounds, electric guitars soloing, vibrating bass, jazzy and tribal drumming, noisy and very psychedelic atmosphere - this album isn't just collection of songs, it's a great piece of art in whole! By its scale this release reminded me the time when Pink Floyd's albums were each such piece of art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After some listening this album growth in me, and I believe I will need to listen it more and more. One of greatest surprise of 2010!
