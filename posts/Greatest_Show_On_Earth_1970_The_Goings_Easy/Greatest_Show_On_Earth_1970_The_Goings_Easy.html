    THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH were originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Garth-Roy and his bass-playing brother Norman. The original line-up included organist Mick Deacon, drummer Ron Prudence and three horns players, Dick Hanson, Tex Phillpotts and Ian Aitcheson. The band's first vocalist was black American Ozzie Lane but he returned to his native New Orleans a year later and was replaced by Colin Horton-Jennings, not only a strong gravel-voiced singer but also quite adept on the guitar, bongos and flute. The group's mixture of R&amp;B soul, jazz and prog rock brought them to the attention of EMI's progressive label Harvest Records, who signed the band and issued, in february 1970, the single, "Real Cool World"/"Again And Again" which, though not a hit in the UK, gave the band a medium-sized hit across Europe where they were also an in-demand live attraction. Both tracks featured on their March 1970 debut LP, "Horizons" which was housed in a distinctive sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and coincided with a Radio One session for Mike Harding on which they played three new songs: "Borderline", "Mountain Song" and "Time". A second session for Harding, in November 1970, featured "The Leader" and "Check Me Into Your Life", the latter of which has never officially been released. "Tell The Story"/"The Mountain Song" had failed to chart when released in September 1970, and the same fate awaited the band's second album "The Going's Easy" though one track from the LP, "Magic Woman Touch" was later released by THE HOLLIES.

    The lack of chart success contributed to the band splitting in mid-1971. Ron Prudence, Ian Aitcheson and Tex Phillpotts quit music altogether, whilst Horton-Jennings joined CHASER and later turned up in TAGGET releasing one self-titled album for EMI in 1974. Dick Hanson turned to session work and recorded with the likes of THE BLUES BAND, GRAHAM PARKER, DAVE EDMUNDS, KIRSTY McCOLL and SHAKIN' STEVENS. Mike Deacon joined VINEGAR JOE and then became a member of both the SUZI QUATRO BAND and DARTS. Norman Watt-Roy formed GLENCOE releasing two albums for Epic, "Glencoe" and "The Spirit Of Glencoe". He then formed LOVING AWARENESS, releasing one self-titled LP in 1976 for More Love Records, before the band eventually evolved into THE BLOCKHEADS, the backing band for IAN DURY. Today he is a member of the WILKO JOHNSON BAND. Garth Watt-Roy joined FUZZY DUCK before undertaking session work for the likes of EAST OF EDEN, LIMEY and BONNIE TYLER as well as being a member of MARMELADE, THE Q-TIPS and THE BARRON KNIGHTS.

    The second album of TGSOE, released fairly shortly after their debut, is a bit different than the brass-heavy debut. The group is now only a sextet as the Repertoire reissue of the album mentions indicates as only Hanson is mentioned from the brass band, but we get some sax from one other blower. The train-artwork is much tamer, which is wise regarding the band's name and the album still out on Harvest and reissued by Repertoire in the early 90's, but I find the sound a bit poor&gt;&gt; remastering needed.

    The album is definitely more appealing to hard prog rockers, especially after an intriguing distorted intro of the 9-min opener Borderline promises and they convince in the UK proto-prog realm. The other lengthy track Love Magnet is definitely in the JR/F territory with some almost-perfect lines and might sound at times as Van Morrison's Young Lovers and at other excellent Chicago

    But the group was still trying to pump some potential hits like Magic Woman Touch (with some very unwise/ill-advised sound effects), or the energetic Story Times, the rocking- rolling Leader and the album closer piano-dominated sing-along (no doubt it was designed as such in concerts) Tell The Story, which was on the accompanying single's B- side. As a bonus track comes the single A-side non-album track Mountain Song, which doesn't really add much.

    The band would tour until the half of next year before disbanding, domestic lack of success being the main reason. Indeed in the mid-70's, their record company gave the band another try at success by reissuing both albums together, mostly on the band's strengths and The Hollies' successful cover of Magic Woman Touch. But as far as this writer is concerned, TGSOE was not destined to become a long running group, but this second album seems a better effort than their debut as it is much more even and progressive. But none are essential to a proghead, and unless you have a knack for brass-rock, they will stay that way.
