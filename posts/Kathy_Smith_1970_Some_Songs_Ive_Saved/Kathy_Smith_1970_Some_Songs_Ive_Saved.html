  Rex Reed's review from the April 1970 issue of Stereo Review:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Once upon a time, Kathy Smith would have been called a folk singer. Now this charming balladeer is aptly representative of the music of today. Just as Judy Collins bridged that musical generation gap from straight-folk to `pop' singer, so now Kathy steps right across it. No longer do these ladies (and gents) tune up their trusty guitars and winsomely wail about `John Riley.' Like Miss Smith, today's folk-pop artists are more likely to be singing their own music, which, in Kathy's case, is lyrically and romantically excellent. Surrounding Kathy's charming, strong, and reflective voice are extremely talented musicians like Jeremy Steig on flute, Monte Dunn on lead guitar, Jim Fielder and Chuck Ramney on bass, and Bill La Vorgna on drums, among others.

   "The album has its own particular and unusual style--a kind of neo-Classicism...[with] a very sensual rock beat that can run hot and cool. One of the most fantasy-filled and most beautiful songs on the album is titled `End of the World,' and it is written by Miss Smith. There are shadings of jazz and Villa-Lobos, with Jeremy Steig's flute illuminating the tropical landscape. Some intros reminded me of Judy Collins singing `Bird on a Wire' or Nina Simone singing `Suzanne.' But Kathy swings immediately into her very own song and her very own styling. `What Nancy Knows' is one of the best examples. I'm impressed too with the sheer professionalism of the arrangements and instrumentalists, and Kathy herself is up to matching both elements. She is perfectly willing to use her voice as another instrumental thread to be woven in and out of this honest American musical fabric. Kathy and company are to be paid serious attention."

   Originally released in 1970 on the miniscule Stormy Forrest label, Kathy Smith's Some Songs I've Saved is no lost treasure on the level of, say, Linda Perhacs' Parallelograms, no matter how much obscurantist collectors may want it to be. Stormy Forrest was Richie Havens' label, and Havens' signature blend of folk and jazz influences is all over this album musically, with flutes and upright bass alongside the acoustic guitars, strings, and Indian instruments. But Smith is not a particularly soulful or jazzy singer: indeed, if anything, she's oddly stiff and proper, over-enunciating her lyrics in songs like "Same Old Lady" like a much more mannered version of the early Judy Collins, when a looser, more rhythmically freewheeling approach would have worked better. Similarly, the songs are fine examples of the whole chamber folk school of female singer/songwriters from this era, but the arrangements are neither trippily psychedelic nor old-school Elizabethan enough to attract the full attention of the Judee Sill and Vashti Bunyan devotees one would assume to be the target audience for this reissue. At its worst, Some Songs I've Saved is merely drearily competent, and at its best (the opening "Topanga," the delicate ballad "If I Could Touch You"), it's a solid L.A. folk-rock album in the early Joni Mitchell school. Don't approach it expecting a magical lost treasure and you likely won't be disappointed, but Some Songs I've Saved is a fairly slight curio overall.
