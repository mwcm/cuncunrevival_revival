   Just listened to this recording for first time in a long time. I was lucky enough to be there for one of the nights they recorded it at Wise Fools, my favorite north-side club - the reincarnation of it after it closed down was a disappointment. Son was always a performer you could count on to give it his all live; unfortunately too many blues artists in those days in Chicago were rather inconsistent in their performances. This was an excellent show and the recording is true to the vibe in the room. I have to agree with the other reviewers who note how Alligator overproduced the soul out of most of their artists in studio recordings. On the other hand, Bruce Iglauer had a lot to do with keeping an otherwise dying genre at the time alive and provide some meager income to a lot of deserving artists.

   One of my long-time regrets about this album was the fact that Johnny Winter was a guest star for an amazing set with Son that night (seem to recall an incredible "Stormy Monday" version). From what I heard back when the album came out, Winter's record label (Warner Brothers?) wouldn't allow any of his performance with Son on little Alligator's album. Truly petty and truly disappointing. Anybody out there got a bootleg?...
