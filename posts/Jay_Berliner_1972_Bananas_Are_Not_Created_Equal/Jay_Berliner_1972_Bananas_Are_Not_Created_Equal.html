  <br/>
  'Bananas are not created equal' is recorded under his own name. Recorded in 1972, under the aegis of arranger Wade Marcus (who also wrote this tune) ‘Bananas…’ featured Berliner and a group of studio heavies working it out on a number of contemporary covers (Temptations, Al Green, Bill Withers) and a couple of excellent, funky originals. ‘Stickball’ opens with Ray Barretto’s congas and Berliner’s guitar, then joined by Cornell Dupree on electric sitar and Paul Griffin on clavinet. The tune has a thick, jazz-funk groove, with some hot soloing (naturally) by Berliner.
  <br/>
  The rest of the album is definitely worth checking out...
