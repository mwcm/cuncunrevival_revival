    Composer / arranger / bandleader Michael Gibbs was one of the most prominent figures on the burgeoning British Jazz scene at its peak. He performed (as trombonist), composed and arranged music for many ensembles active at the time, in parallel to leading his own band, which is captured here during a residency at the legendary Ronnie Scott’s club in London. The band included the top British Jazz players of the time, most of which played on Michel’s previous two studio recordings: Kenny Wheeler, Henry Lowther, Harry Beckett (trumpet), Chris Pyne, Malcolm Griffiths, Geoff Perkins (trombone), Ray Warleigh, Stan Sulzmann, Alan Skidmore (saxophone), Dave MacRae, John Taylor (piano), Chris Spedding (guitar), Roy Babbington (bass), John Marshall (drums) and Frank Ricotti (vibes &amp; percussion). The music covers a wide range of styles, from the typical atmospheric and moody compositions by Gibbs, to scorching Jazz-Rock Fusion exemplified mostly by Spedding’s lead guitar parts and even Blues. Gibbs pays a tribute to some of his American pioneering colleagues: Gary Burton, Steve Swallow, Carla Bley and Keith Jarrett, whom he befriended during his studies in the US, by including his arrangements of their tunes. Notably Gibbs kept looking across the Atlantic for inspiration, being somewhat different in that respect from most of his British contemporaries, who wanted to emancipate themselves from American influence as much as possible. Nevertheless his unique approach to composition and arrangement was clearly much more advanced than most stuff coming over from America. The raw energy and the virtuosity of the players make this album one of the greatest documents of the era, which remains a timeless masterpiece. A must for British Jazz lovers!

    It's encouraging to see that today's listening public accepts artists not bound by style, who can play not only in a variety of jazz forms, but also outside its purview. Artists like Bill Frisell regularly step outside more rigid definitions of jazz—not just on his own records, but also with singer/songwriters like Robin Holcomb, Marianne Faithful, and Kelly Joe Phelps.

    Back in the 1970s, however, cross-pollination was almost a given. In Britain, while artists like trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, pianist John Taylor, and bassist Roy Babbington could be found engaged in more "pure jazz pursuits, they could also be found on records by artists like drummer Bill Bruford, Splinter, and blues maven Alexis Korner—albums that barely skirted jazz borders, if at all. And within jazz? Players were exploring every potential, from the jazz-rock of trumpeter Ian Carr's Nucleus and Soft Machine to the free jazz of saxophonist Elton Dean and drummer Tony Oxley.

    So when Zimbabwe-born Mike Gibbs settled in London in 1965—after studying at Boston's Berklee School of Music and rubbing shoulders with the likes of Gary Burton and Carla Bley—the trombonist found himself in the midst of a scene that some have called the golden age of British jazz. And while he was no slouch as a player, he'd ultimately go on to make a bigger name for himself as composer, arranger, and orchestrator, working on projects as diverse as the Mahavishnu Orchestra's Apocalypse and Joni Mitchell's Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. He released a number of albums of his own which are now considered classics, including In the Public Interest and Only Chrome-Waterfall Orchestra.

    Add to that list Just Ahead, recently rescued from obscurity by Britain's BGO Records. The two-CD set, culled from performances at London's Ronnie Scott's in 1972, features a veritable who's who of British jazz—Wheeler, Taylor, and Babbington are there, but so are woodwind multi-instrumentalists Stan Sulzmann, Ray Warleig, and Alan Skidmore; trumpeters Henry Lowther and Harry Beckett; pianist David McRae; and drummer John Marshall.

    The nine lengthy compositions from Gibbs, Bley, Burton, and Keith Jarrett are all given the progressive and broad-scaled treatment for which Gibbs had already become renowned. There are elements of rock in Jarrett's "Grow Your Own, blues in Bley's "Sing Me Softly of the Blues, and free orchestral jazz in Gibbs'"So Long Gone. Within a spectrum extending from a pure jazz aesthetic at one end to rock-influenced bands like Nucleus and Soft Machine at the other, Gibbs perches somewhere in the middle, sliding either way at will.

    The performances are all outstanding, but special note deserves to be made of Chris Spedding—a uitarist far removed from jazz proper, yet able to comfortably make his way through Gibbs' challenging arts, adding colorations that more schooled players might not consider.

   <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Long overdue, BGO's reissue of Just Ahead captures Gibbs at arguably the height of his powers. Let's hope this means that reissues of In the Public Interest and Only Chrome-Waterfall Orchestra are not far behind.
