   While Andy Fraser and Paul Rodgers quickly assumed leadership of Free's studio albums and developing sound, it's Paul Kossoff that shines when they play live. Whether it's because there's less opportunity for additional instruments to reduce his role as had happened in the studio, or simply because Kossoff excelled in a live environment, he's very much to the fore here. Free were a great band anyway. They had the rare combination of being great players raised to another level by the chemistry they had as a unit. Kirke set the tone for the bands sound, with simple but powerful back beats. Fraser's cool funky bass lines provided the youthful, cocky strut. Rodger's dry, unadorned vocals articulated sex, sensitivity and sorrow as needs be. Kossoff was the bands wild heart, capable of heavy, groovy riffs, unrestrained solos and genuine, original, honest blues. Nobody plays like Kossoff. Like so many great bands belonging to any era, the intensity required to maintain such a high standard of recorded output burnt them out. Thankfully they kept busy before then.

   The two gigs these recordings were taken from took place either side of Free's commercial explosion after the "All Right Now" single (January-September 1970). People called it overnight success but Free had already recorded two quality albums and had a following built largely on their live reputation. Originally only eight tracks when released, whoever compiled the album included most of the big hitters in that initial sequence. I was surprised at how loose and 'live'"All Right Now" was the first time I heard this version. The guitar cuts out at points, the riff isn't always clean, but I actually prefer it now. Conceived as a live song to get people moving, the energy's enhanced by the imperfections. Any misdemeanors can be put down to over exuberance and it's great to hear a song people have heard millions of times roughed up in this way. "Be My Friend" is one of the standout Free tracks and one of the best ballads ever written. Kossoff's rippling guitar is vulnerable and tender during the verses, articulate and heartbreaking during the solos. Rodgers brilliance as a vocalist is really apparent here. Lyrically, it's nothing particularly noteworthy and could even be mawkish in the hands of a less emotive singer, but Rodgers sings with such purity and soul the sentiments become universal and real. I became familiar with most of these songs from this album before hearing their studio equivalents and Mr. Big always sounded better live. Starting with a simple beat, a sparse, unhurried riff and menacing vocals, the song builds into a blistering crescendo complete with bass solo. I know few people who could recall many great bass solos but Kossoff sets such a climactic, exciting backdrop the track just gets better and better and Fraser was a formidable bass player. "The Hunter" is an apt inclusion on any Free album. It almost encapsulates them, acknowledging the music that inspired them while still making still it their own. The thundering intro brought to life by the wailing guitar is some way to build anticipation. It sounds like the alarm sounding after a predator's been let loose. Few songs have such a distinct, signature opening. The closing studio track "Get Where I Belong" was recorded during abandoned sessions for a fifth album. Perhaps its poignancy would only have been truly felt at the time as it's inclusion is a kind of farewell, expressing regret at things that have been but still hopeful for the future in light of the bands split. It would've been the actual final track originally whereas now on the 2002 reissue a handful of bonus tracks follow. It's a decent song, perhaps a slight step down from the slower moments on 'Highway' but that says more about the quality of the tracks that preceded it.

   The bonus tracks pluck some of the lesser known numbers out. With some bands you feel you could pretty accurately predict what would be in a live set but Free were such consummate musicians and already had so many great songs that they played a fair range of their catalogue to this point. An epic 9-minute rendition of "Moonshine" from the bands first album would surprise most people only familiar with "All Right Now." It's always been one of my favorites from their debut. Free always did sorrow well, but some of their initial efforts had a morose, haunting ambience and "Moonshine" gets a heavy, full on treatment here, ringing every ounce of melancholy from the composition. The riff for "Woman" sounds fuller here and "Trouble on Double Time" always had a bit more thrust live, as opposed to the studio version which sounds a bit light. "Walk in my Shadow" is another favorite of mine from 'Tons of Sobs', starting with Kossoff's trademark vibrato leading into a typical Free riff, heavy but groovy, cocksure, confident, sexual rather than romantic.

   I have periods where I don't listen to Free, though "Highway" is an album I come back to often. I've been digging their sound lately and wasn't sure exactly what ratings I'd given each album or whether I'd reviewed them all. I know Free had once been the only band I'd awarded my highest marks to for four consecutive albums ('Tons of Sobs', 'Free', 'Fire and Water' and 'Highway'). Though I've only kept 'Free' and 'Highway' that high as they have the best songs and I have a preference for Free's soul side compared to the blues rock of 'Fire and Water'. When I looked earlier I found I'd given 'Free Live' a 4 and though my review sounds like a 5 star review if ever I heard one, I still feel reluctant. I don't know if they included alternate versions of "All Right Now" and "Mr. Big" to show how they varied from one night to the next, but they feel superfluous. They aren't better than the ones on the original album and I'd rather the space was filled up for different tracks. The 'Songs of Yesterday' boxset featured outtakes from these shows and included 'The Stealer', 'Songs of Yesterday', 'Free Me' and a blistering cover of 'Crossroads' recorded when the band were exhausted after two encores though it doesn't show. The alternate 'Get Where I Belong' seems unnecessary as well. It detracts from the original to have this inferior take tacked on the end.

   For better or worse, making it in rock 'n' roll seems to require much more than ability, sincerity and dedication. A band requires luck, good timing and foresight to become a household name, if they even want to. Some bands court celebrity and end up vain hypocrites, milking the myth 'til they die, losing touch with the feeling that compelled them in the first place. Free's relative lack of recognition in light of how good their albums are mystifies me sometimes. Should the band responsible for "I'll Be Creepin", "Free Me", "Fire and Water" and countless others be remembered for "All Right Now"? I have friends who are into hard rock who dig Free, friends who are into soul who love Free, friends who are folkies that love Free, friends who sing that love Paul Rodgers, friends who play guitar and love Paul Kossoff. I can think of many bands who lack their lack of pretensions and genuine sense of identity. Immediately after they had a hit, the band already lamented playing to fans already won over, teenyboppers who'd have a good time regardless of how well they played. How long have the Rolling Stones been going? In an era where hard rock bands became synonymous with over indulgence and bloated on their own hype Free unassumingly made better albums than them. I can only assume the disappointing sales for 'Highway' were down to mismanagement and uncertainty over how to follow 'Fire and Water'. It always amused me that having been dispirited by their lack of recognition commercially pre-"All Right Now", Kossoff was the first to stress the substance of their other work. The fact that all the members failed to really hit these heights again suggests they had something going before the split in 1971. Though the original line-up reunited for the 'Free at Last' album in an attempt to rescue Kossoff from the despair he felt after the break-up, it wasn't really the same and you get the sense the chain had been broken. How Rodgers and Fraser ended up despising each other I have no idea, but hell, they were only just out of their teens.

   As an additional tidbit. While even hearing Paul Kossoff playing a solo live paralyses me with excitement, watching footage of the guy play live is something else. The kind of faces he pulls confirm that he was pulling that stuff out from somewhere deep down, wrenching out something internal and giving it the appropriate sound. You won't find a picture of Kossoff playing live where he doesn't look like he might just be playing the last solo of his life.
