   When listening to Volume, it soon becomes evident that Ray Gomez gets more soul, more feel, and more tone, than any other guitar player on the planet. Add in impeccable placed notes with "Albert King-like" timing, the album represents guitar playing that is hard to beat. Something else that needs to be said, Ray "rocks". He is very keen on the groove within a song. Besides blistering leads, Ray keeps funk and rock groove rhythm in his playing. One could listen to Blues for Mez or West Side Boogie and say, "Well, there's killer blues being played, funk being played, and a steady rockin' groove. In essence, Ray Gomez is nothing short of a powerhouse. He gets more out of a guitar than is almost humanly possible, yet he does not overplay. Ray has the uncanny ability to play exactly what is needed for a song, yet with innovation, feel, and soaring power. U.S.A. is actually my favorite song on the record. It also establishes another front -- that Ray is a damn good song writer and composer. Volume is a hidden gem that needs to be rediscovered. It's still relevant and fresh today as it was when first released.

   Unfortunately, due to record company politics this album never had a chance (even though it charted in cities like St. Louis when it was released and did get some radio play). If you don't know who Ray is, he is a studio guitarist and also played for the likes of Stanley Clarke (in his touring band) and Roy Buchanan (who said that Ray was the best guitarist he ever heard). Other fans were George Harrison, Jeff Beck and Billy Gibbons. This set has a couple weak tunes, but generally this is a fantastic rock guitar extravaganza! "West Side Boogie" just kills (Shawn Lane loved Ray, and did this piece on his "Powers of 10 CD), and "Blues for Mez" is a beautiful moody blues tune with some great jazz phrasing. His vocals are good, the songs are (almost all) great, and his solos are to die for. This album can be found on CD sometimes from Audiophile Imports, very worthwhile if you can find it!
