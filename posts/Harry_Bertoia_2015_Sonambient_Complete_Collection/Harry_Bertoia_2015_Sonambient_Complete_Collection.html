  Arieto Bertoia was born on March 10, 1915, in the small village of San Lorenzo, Friuli, Italy, about 50 miles north of Venice and 70 miles south of Austria. He had one brother, Oreste, and one sister, Ave. Another sister died at eighteen months old; she was the subject of one of his first paintings. Even as a youngster, the local brides would ask him to design their wedding day linen embroidery patterns, as his talents were already recognized. He attended high school in Arzene, Carsara, until age 15. He then accompanied his father to Detroit to visit his brother Oreste. Upon entering North America, his birth name Arri, which often morphed into the nickname Arieto ("little Harry" in Italian), was altered to the Americanized "Harry." Bertoia stayed in Michigan to attend Cass Technical High School, a public school with a special program for talented students in arts and sciences. Later, a one-year scholarship to the Art School of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts allowed him to study painting and drawing. He entered and placed in many local art competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the fall of 1937, another scholarship entitled him to become a student, again of painting and drawing, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Cranbrook was, at the time, an amazing melting pot of creativity attracting many famous artists and designers: Carl Milles, resident-sculptor, Maija Grotell, resident-ceramist, Walter Gropius, visiting Bauhaus-architect, and others. Students did not receive a degree; rather they discovered their passion. This residence at Cranbrook was a momentous turning point in Harry’s life and career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1939, Eliel Saarinen, director of the art community, asked Bertoia, age 24, to stay on at the academy to re-open the metalworking shop. With the war-time need for metals, Bertoia was forced to concentrate on jewelry, which did not use as much metal. He shared jewelry with his friends at Cranbrook and made wedding rings for Ray Eames and Edmund Bacon’s wife Ruth. The organic shapes and fine detail of the jewelry later evolved into the early sculpture forms. He was part of the “art to wear” movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry also continued an after-hour activity he had begun as a student, experimenting and producing one-of-a-kind prints and drawings later known as monoprints. The monotypes of the 1940s are considered some of his most imaginative graphics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow students at Cranbrook - Florence Shust (Knoll), Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen - were influential to Bertoia’s life in later years. In 1940, Harry met Brigitta Valentiner, the daughter of Wilhelm Valentiner, Director of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the foremost expert on Rembrandt in the U.S. Brigitta pursued him relentlessly, and he and Brigitta were married on May 10, 1943.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While at Cranbrook, Harry Bertoia sent 100 prints to The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum of Non-Objective Paintings for evaluation. To his amazement, Hilla Rebay, the acquisitions director, kept all 100 prints. She bought some for herself and some for the museum. In 1943, 19 of those prints were exhibited by the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation. Harry had the most works by a single artist in that show, which included works by Moholy-Nagy, Werner Drewes and Charles Smith. Supported by a stipend from Karl Nierendorf of Nierendorf Gallery in New York, Harry continued to hold exhibits of jewelry and drawings. Harry designed two sleek tea sets; one for Eliel Saarinen which is in the Cranbrook permanent collection and the second at the Detroit Institute of Art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1943, Bertoia amiably left Cranbrook to join Charles Eames in California to pursue ongoing experimental work on molded plywood. The plywood work stemmed from a continuation of the Eames/Saarinen Cranbrook chair design that won the Museum of Modern Art furniture competition. The award winning chair could not be successfully mass produced, so the mission was to find a way in which to do so. In addition, he contributed to the war effort making airplane parts manufactured by Evans Products Co, where Eames was director of Resarch &amp; Development. Harry's innovative chair solutions made production possible and were adopted by Eames with no credit attributed to Bertoia. In frustration, Bertoia moved on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spent two years in San Diego, at Point Loma Naval Electrical Lab, where he worked on a project involving human engineering (ergonomics, although the word had not yet been invented) and stroboscopic photography designed to evaluate equipment. This is where he began making metal sculptures after hours, while continuing to create the monoprint drawings. In 1945, Harry held a show of his monotypes at the San Francisco Museum of Art. He became an American citizen in 1946. His daughter Lesta and son Val were born in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1950, at the invitation of Hans and Florence Knoll of Knoll, Inc. furniture design company, Harry moved to eastern Pennsylvania with his growing family. The Knolls had seen his work at Cranbrook and suspected he had more ideas inside. They offered him free rein to design what he wished - furniture or sculpture - with full credit and complete recognition of his work, which was their policy with all designers. The Bertoia Diamond chair series was introduced in 1952 by Knoll. Bertoia also designed all the jigs for the production of the items. Harry set up shop in Bally in an old leaky garage building. The chair became part of the “modern” furniture movement of the 1950s. In the span of a couple of years, Bertoia completed several chair designs for Knoll. They compensated him handsomely for his wildly popular work, enabling Bertoia to purchase the farmhouse he had been renting, as well as his shop in Bally. Daughter Celia was born in Pennsylvania. The 1800’s rural stone house and the shop are still in the family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first architectural sculpture commission that Harry earned was in 1953 for the General Motors Technical Center, thanks to designer and Cranbrook pal Eero Saarinen. Also commissioned by Eero Saarinen was the altar piece in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chapel, created in 1955. This is one of the most striking sculptures by Harry Bertoia. It ushers in the contemporary era of spacial sculpture, liberated from a base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1957, Harry received a grant from Chicago's Graham Foundation, affording him the opportunity to return to Italy for the first time since 1930. He visited relatives and most of the great Italian museums, reveling in the travels. He never managed to return to Italy again, although he fervently wished to do so. During this period, he began earning awards, which would continue for the rest of his life. The first European exhibit of his sculptural work was at the US Pavilion of the 1958 Brussels World's Fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1959 brought the first of many sculptural shows to the Staempfli Gallery, New York. They held a retrospective show in 1981. Each exhibition boasted beautiful full color catalogs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drawings, or monographics, were part of Harry’s creative process throughout his career. Many of them clearly show his planning and experimentation with ideas for sculptures. He enjoyed the way that the free form medium of ink and paper permitted him to get his ideas on paper quickly and spontaneously. June Kompass Nelson authored an informative and well-illustrated book on the monoprints entitled Harry Bertoia, Printmaker, in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1960, Harry Bertoia started the exploration of tonal sculptures. The "tonal", or sounding sculpture, is the art that is most often associated with Harry Bertoia. Their sizes vary from a few inches all the way up to 20+ feet. Many metals were used for the rods, the most common being beryllium copper known for its wide range of color variations. Some rods are capped with cylinders or drops of metal, which, by their weight, accentuate the swaying of the tonal rods. Harry and Oreste (his brother) both loved music and spent endless happy hours experimenting and finding new sounds to incorporate into Sonambient, the auditory and visual environment created by the tonals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry set up his remodeled barn in 1968-1969 to hold his special collection of 100+ tonal sculptures and act as a sound recording studio. He gave small concerts to visitors and friends. Bertoia recorded 11 albums of the haunting sounds of sculpture known as Sonambient during his lifetime. The original albums are now available on CD. Three major documentaries featuring the barn and other pieces were released about Bertoia, one of which was made by Clifford West, a colleague from Cranbrook. The Sonambient Barn has remained as he left it to this day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spur of the tonal experimentation was the dandelion form, which resembled a dandelion flower gone to seed. The 1964 New York World’s Fair Kodak building displayed seven gold-plated dandelions around a spraying fountain. Hundreds of carefully welded thin rods around a center orb became a spectacle of shiny wonder. These created quite a stir and are still extremely popular, fetching the highest prices of all Bertoia sculptures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From 1953 to 1978 Harry Bertoia crafted numerous large sculptural commissions. Harry Bertoia made over 50 public sculptures of all types, which are on display in cities throughout the United States as well as abroad. Harry Bertoia was hired and admired by the greatest architects of the time, including Eero Saarinen, Henry Dreyfuss, Roche &amp; Dinkeloo, Minoru Yamasaki, and Edward Durell Stone &amp; I M Pei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1971, Muhlenberg College of Allentown, PA, paid tribute to Harry with an Honorary Doctorate degree in Fine Arts. The Allentown Art Museum, close to his home, has shown their respect of Bertoia’s work with several exhibits both during his lifetime and since. Bertoia has been honored by local admirers near his residence in Pennsylvania as well as collectors all over the world. Bertoia was selected to do the memorial piece for the Marshall University football team in Huntington, WV, in 1972. The 2006 movie, We Are Marshall, outlines the tragic plane crash. The 6500 pound 13’ high sculpture commemorates the 75 lives taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two large exhibitions were well received in Oslo, Norway, but a tragic fire destroyed several large sculptures as well as numerous monoprints. Bertoia was deeply saddened by the loss, especially of the monoprints. A successful show in Caracas, Venezuela received rave reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Learning of the dismal diagnosis of cancer caused Bertoia to work furiously on organizing his monoprints, perfecting the tonal barn collection, and putting his life’s work in order. He had produced more than 50,000 pieces of art during his short life. His work had consumed most of his time, much of his passion, and ultimately all of his energy. Toxic fumes from the materials he worked with, such as the beryllium copper he so loved, contributed to the lung cancer. Yet, his death was peaceful, he felt complete, and he accepted dying as simply one more graceful part of life. Harry Bertoia died at age 63 on November 6th, 1978. After his death, his wife Brigitta, his son Val, and his daughter Lesta continued the musical barn concert tradition begun by Harry. His wife Brigitta died in 2007 shortly after her 87th birthday. His children Val and Lesta are artists in their own right, while daughter Celia has taken over the handling of his monoprints. Lesta paints intuitive portraits and dreamy spiritual landscapes. The studio in Bally, PA, is still used today by Val Bertoia, his son, who is a sculptor and inventor. Bertoia is buried behind the Sonambient Barn under a huge 1-ton Bertoia gong.

  “Man is not important. Humanity is what counts, to which, I feel, I have given my contribution. Humanity shall continue without me, but I am not going away. I am not leaving you. Every time you see some tree tops moving in the wind, you will think of me. Or you will see some beautiful flowers; you will think of me. I have never been a very religious man, not in the formal way, but each time I took a walk in the woods, I felt the presence of a superior force around me.”

  In the late fifties Harry Bertoia began working on long-form improvised compositions by utilizing pure acoustic tones produced using his own pure metal sound sculptures.   Bertoia coined the term "Sonambient" to describe the music of his sculptures and the lush overtones they evoked, renovated a barn on his property deep in the PA woods, and often recorded his nightly sessions in the barn using 4 overhead microphones and a 1/4" tape recorder. Bertoia dedicated the last twenty years of his life to his Sonambient work and in 1970 he released the first Sonambient LP. In 1978, in the final months of his life, he selected recordings from his archive and produced 10 more Sonambient records. He would not live long enough to see these records in person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Complete Sonambient Collection features all 11 Bertoia Sonambient releases newly restored from the original master reels. A heavy duty box holds 11 CDs each packaged in replica sleeves and a 100 page booklet contains a lengthy historic essay, a Smithsonian interview with Harry Bertoia, exclusive Sonambient era material from the Bertoia archive,  photos of the Sonambient barn during Harry's lifetime and updated with many shots of the barn today.  Also included are reflections on Bertoia from David Sefton, Tom Welsh, David Harrington (Kronos Quartet) and all three of Bertoia's children.
  <br/>
  2015 is the centennial celebration of the birth of Harry Bertoia on March 10, 1915. To celebrate Harry's life and work Important Records Important Records will release a CD box set containing the complete edition of Bertoia's privately pressed Sonambient LPs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Bertoia's use of the term "Sonambient" to describe both his sculptures and their sound pre-date the term "ambient" being used to describe a form of music. The origins of his Sonambient sculptures are found in his brilliant, early monotypes. It wasn't until 1960 that he began the exploration of these tonal sculptures and then not until the early seventies that he began recording his lengthy concerts. He ritually played his meditative performances in his post and beam barn on 200 acres in Barto, Pennsylvania up in the hills not far away from his Bally, PA studio. It's the sacred, personal feeling one has in Bertoia's barn that we hope to evoke with the packaging and archival  materials accompanying these recordings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We live in a new age with sounds never before heard. They can be strident, tranquil, violent, fluctuating, depending on the metal, the size of the rods, or the group of the rods. I always feel more drawn to this barn, the changes are omnipresent and every person has the responsibility to find new ways of making things. This is what forms our character. I cannot say that I am not unchangeable. There is a progression in the world. It is part of my role in life to discover this progression."

  The works of Harry Bertoia celebrate the bounty of the good earth; shimmering sheafs of golden wheat stalked in endless rows on 'the fruitful plain'; great crashing cataracts, with crystal-pure and steel hard volutes; or the swift, mystic rushing of myriad-rayed comets against the sky's infinity. To suggest so much, by means so simple, is the mark of a great lyrical poet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bertoia's sculptures and his sounds are a conceptual string, or literal vibrations, that weave together all of his work. You see the shape of the sound sculptures appear in his mono-prints and suddenly even his famous chairs resonate with sounds when you pluck at them or run a pencil down the lines. Through Sonambient, Bertoia's lifetime of work resonates, echoes, bubbles with overtones and comes alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry's single greatest piece of art is the totality of his life which is nearly impossible to measure but somehow easy to feel.

  There are some experiences for which words will never quite suffice. Most often, these are phenomena found in relatively untouched nature: the feeling one gets when gazing out over a large canyon, perhaps, or the myriad sensory stimuli that come with being enveloped by a waterfall (highly recommended if you've never tried it, by the way). For such experiences, language is hopelessly deficient, enough so to justify insufferable assertions of the "you just had to be there" variety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Bertoia was the rare artist who could manifest uncanny visceral experiences nearly worthy of Ma Nature herself, constructing complete and lucid statements with little but common metals, magnetic tape, and imagination. A successful sculptor and architect, Bertoia dedicated the last two decades of his life to his "sonambient" work, a self-invented form somewhere between sculpture and musical instrument which he insisted was neither. Consisting largely of industrial metal wire, sheeting, and the like, these pieces were designed to engage sight, sound, and touch; their elemental, idiosyncratic appearance, and doubly their staggering sound, make the idea of an "artist statement" utilizing the written word seem positively redundant and petty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Complete Sonambient Collection, a new 11 CD box set, makes widely available recordings of these pieces previously found only on coveted private press LPs, and also appends some unreleased tapes which the folks at Important Records assure us is but the tip of the iceberg and a harbinger of more things to come. Taken as a whole, the set is sprawling and overwhelming, but it's also an essential grip for any sound explorer worth their salt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on interviews (including an extensive one included in the set at hand), Bertoia was as articulate as the next guy, but he was much better at defining what sonambient was not than what it was. The pieces aren't really sculptures, but they're not really instruments; they aren't just making noise, but Bertoia didn't think that what his creations generated was music, either. John Cage isn't the only person who would have contested the latter assertion, but musical or no, the sonambient pieces are powerfully physical: they created heavy reverberations which rang not just throughout Bertoia's Pennsylvania barn studio, but through anyone present to hear them. People who have visited the space and experienced the sonambient works up close speak of deep bodily vibrations, of "an actual physical landscape being created in sound". I've personally never been, and many will never get to go (though one can still book a tour at reasonable rates), but Bertoia had the foresight to extensively document his work in picture and sound for the curious. The recorded evidence is remarkable, but its lack of substantial physical presence does beg one's imagination to fill in gaps that can only truly be filled by experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, the sounds of The Complete Sonambient Collection can yield a wide variety of mental and emotional interpretations. A section that sounds like outtakes from the soundtrack to Eraserhead or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to one, might conjure a womb-like serenity for another; ostensibly pretty sections could easily evoke melancholy or anxiety to ears/brains attuned just so. These are sounds that heighten the senses more than direct them, leaving plenty to each listener's own inner workings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To casual passersby, The Complete Sonambient Collection will probably just sound like a lot of clanging metal - which, admittedly, it kind of is - and even somewhat inattentive ears may have trouble seeing the appeal of an extensive box set whose pieces are often difficult to differentiate upon a cursory listen. For those with a little more attention to give, however, The Complete Sonambient Collection offers deep listening of the highest order. These are sounds which are as worthy of heavy contemplation as any, but they're even better when you just let go and feel them like so much sand between your toes, as an eternal sound for which there can be no words.

  In the ’50s, renowned sculptor/furniture designer, Harry Bertoia, had an epiphany when he realized the possibilities of sonic resonance that lived within his creations. He dedicated the final twenty years of his life to the pursuit of sound, eventually releasing his first album as Sonambient in 1970. Ten more LPs would be released near the end of the decade, most of which were pressed after his death. For the very first time, all eleven albums have been carefully remastered and repackaged a single box set with a full color book containing essays, memories and more in a startling tribute to the artist’s legacy.
  <br/>
  The twenty-two tracks that make up Sonambient flow with graceful fluidity, gently ranging from subtle textures to bombastic crashes. A soft breeze rises to a thunderstorm, and the receding tide becomes a cresting wave. Space and time play their parts as well, allowing the pieces to evolve naturally at their own pace, with silence being just as important to the progression of the narrative. Sculpture comes alive, telling stories of feeling rather than words, memories unfolding as brief glimpses of emotion. Bells from an invisible church chime over glacial tundra, betraying an empty darkness that instantly morphs into a frightening void. In many ways, Bertoia’s compositions recall the sinister sound effect symphonies of Tod Dockstader in the icy foreboding they evoke and, like Dockstader, Bertoia also effectively used tape as an instrument, as in “Phosphorescence,” where he “plays” counterpoint to a backwards recording. Elsewhere, his metal breathes on its own – the inhale and exhale of a giant sleeping robot, shadows dispersed by rays of shimmering light.
  <br/>
  Apparently, Harry Beroia recorded hundreds of more tapes that never got pressed to vinyl. Hopefully, these will be released in the coming years so the world can fully grasp the immensity of his unique sound art.
