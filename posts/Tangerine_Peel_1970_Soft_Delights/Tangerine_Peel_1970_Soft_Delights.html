  Tangerine Peel was best known during the second half of the 1960s as a five-man psychedelic band, specializing in a slightly light but pleasant brand of the music. Their principal claim to fame was the presence of future songwriter/producer Mike Chapman in their ranks during the late '60s, when they cut records such as their version of the Bee Gees'"Every Christian Lion-Hearted Man Will Show You," cut for British United Artists in 1967. Subsequent singles included "Solid Gold Mountain" and "Talking to No One" for British CBS, and "Never Say Never Again" and "Play Me a Sad Song and I'll Dance" for British MGM. Chapman left before the group recorded its one and only LP, Soft Delights, in 1970. By that time, the group had abandoned its psychedelic influences in favor of a more conventional pop/rock sound. The group's version of "Every Christian Lion-Hearted Man Will Show You" was reissued in 2004 on Castle's Maybe Someone Is Digging Underground: Songs of the Bee Gees. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide

  MIKE CHAPMAN and friends in 1970 put out a REALLY GREAT lp titled 'SOFT THOUGHTS'...this album has a wide variety of sound from pysch, heavy rock, folk, to bubblegum, this is indeed a TRUE lost gem...the lp kicks off with 'CINDY LOU'...with trashy electric guitars in top form, this song sounds like the inside of a pinball machine crunching along, with lyrics such as 'oh sweet, sweet, sweet, cindy lou, and the sweet, sweet, sweet, things you do' !...next song the title track 'soft delights', a bubblegum song, sunshine pop with the trademark drum stomp,..... sounds like a cornerstone sound of MUD and SWEET,....naturally since he would produce both bands a few yrs later....
  <br/>
  'GOODNIGHT TO THE NIGHT' changes the pace, this one is a soft folk tune with wonderful piano, that takes you to another time, another place...*...side 1 ends with 'what am i to do' with such lyrics such as 'and in front of me stands a girl who will tear and break down my world'...side 2 begins with 'TALKIN''BOUT A NEW DAY'...great revolutionary spirit, and the song reaches for new musical heights...every song is great including 'to judi' a love song, and the lp eds with 'MOMENTS I RECALL' where the singer travels through his memory to bring forth thoughts of wonderment,
