   A legend! On last December 12th, Emmanuel N’ Djoké Dibango, under the name of Manu Dibango, the famous saxophonist and Cameroonian singer celebrated his 85 years! And as he has a large shape, he planned to mark well the occasion! Two parties were scheduled: the first one on December 11th in Paris, then, the second, the next day in Cameroon. Special programs took place all day long on Africa N 1 radio station with the cooperation of Manu and he took this opportunity to also promote his autobiography entitled “Balade en saxo dans les coulisses de ma vie”, published at editions Archipel.

   The singer is from a Protestant environment. At the age of 3years old, he settled in France with his family in Saint Calais (Sarthe). He studies at Chartres, then at Château-Thierry in the beginning of 1950s. He took his high school completion exams in Reims while discovering saxophone. His father stooped given him pocket money in 1956 to protest against the idea that he would like to make a music career! The father did not well know the son!

   He then exiled himself in Brussels, in Anvers and in Charleroi where he met the Diaspora. Grand Kalle hired him in his orchestra. They recorded several records and Manu Dibango came back to Cameroon in 1963 for his first time. He returned to France. Not yet ready…

   “I was not feeling as D’Artagnan”, he told.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1967, Manu Dibango founded his first big band. He participated in several TV programs entitled “Pulsations” which producer was Gésip Légitimus. He coped with French stars at that time such as Dick Rivers and Nino Ferrer. In 1969, he launched himself in solo.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>

Without forgetting Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O’Connor, Dominic Miller (string guitarist) and Manu Katché among others.

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He said about his success: « I have an elastic public! I am not a specialist for music; I am a general practitioner [laughter]! Thus I necessarily touch each other at some point, whether it is the kids or the oldest. You know, doing this business, it is not a matter of following a fashion. You necessary need to be present, to be « of your time » but not of a fashion. Fashions pass. I saw the beginning of many hits, dances… And at the same time, there are also stabilities. The important is to make your choice and to have the possibility of it. »
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He also believed a lot in young talents to come: « I did not do this business to have medals. I did it by passion in order to link up bring love relationships between people. Because it is not the most wide-spread commodity. Yes, it is clear that I am listed at the Francophony! There are a lot of musicians who worked with me and who, when leaving, bring other musicians. It is renewed all the time. Those who work in my orchestra know that they will have to train other musicians if they are taken somewhere else. A way of keeping the continuity ».
