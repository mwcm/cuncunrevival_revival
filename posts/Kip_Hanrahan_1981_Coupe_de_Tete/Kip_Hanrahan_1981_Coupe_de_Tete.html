   I waited a long time to hear this on CD, and the sound is luscious. A track like "This Night Comes Out Of Both Of Us," is sung by Lisa Herman over a hot Afro-Cuban Groove. "Whatever I Want," and "No One Here Gets To Transcend Anything (Except Oil Company Executives)" feature poet Kip Hanrahan speech-singing in a Laurie Anderson style, but because his prose and the groove are so compelling, the tunes work.

   Some other tracks delve deeply into Arto Lindsay's love of "skronk guitar" an obsession I do not share. However, just as it began on a high note, the CD ends with longtime Miles Davis producer Teo Macero's "Heart On My Sleeve," a slow burner with compelling solos by Orlando DiGoralamo on accordion, the composer and Chico Freeman on tenor sax, along with Dave Liebman on soprano (just to give you an idea of the wealth of talent on this CD, bass duties are capably shared by Jamaladeen Tacuma, Bill Laswell and Cecil McBee on electric and stand-up bass, and there are at least half a dozen percussionists.)

   This is one of those early 80s, New York "downtown jazz" CDs that works best when when programmed according to taste. It grabs you when the percussion and vocals are grooving in tandem, and at those moments it is easy to get carried away by this difficult to find CD.

   Fittingly enough, the first sound heard on Kip Hanrahan's premier release is that of the conga and the first word sung is "sex," two leitmotifs that would appear consistently in his ensuing work. Coup de Tete burst on the scene in the early '80s as an entirely fresh, invigorating amalgam of Cuban percussion (much of it Santeria-based), free jazz, funk, and intimate, confrontational lyrics. Hanrahan had worked at New Music Distribution Service, a project run by Carla Bley and Michael Mantler (both of whom appear on this album), and had established contacts with numerous musicians from varied fields who he threw together in a glorious New York City melting pot. With the percussion and electric bass laying down thick and delicious grooves, the cream of the younger avant saxophonists in New York at the time wail over the top, accompanying some of the most brutally uncomfortable lyrics ever put to wax. The relationships Hanrahan details are turbulent to say the least, often intertwined with economic concerns as well as a general sense of the impossibility of understanding one's mate. After asking him for abuse and being refused, his lover (sung wonderfully by Lisa Herman) taunts, "When you could only sulk/I had more contempt for you than I ever thought I could have." Interspersed among the bitter love harangues and ecstatic percussion-driven numbers are two stunningly lovely pieces, Marguerite Duras'"India Song" and Teo Macero's "Heart on My Sleeve," both aching with romanticism. Coup de Tete is a superb record, an impressive debut, and, arguably, one of the finest moments in Hanrahan's career along with the following release, Desire Develops an Edge. Highly recommended.
