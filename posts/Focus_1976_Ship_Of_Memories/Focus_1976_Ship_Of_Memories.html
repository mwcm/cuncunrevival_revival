  Another underrated album. This one features outtakes and rarities from mostly 1973, one track from the first line-up and a few from the later line-up (Mother Focus). Side one is truly great! First track P's March was intented to be a single and fits fine with the early single "House Of The King". Second one "Can't Believe My Eyes" contains very good guitar-work by Jan Akkerman and Focus V is a smooth track, but very beautiful. One of Focus' best tracks in my opinion. Out of Versuvius turned out later as a passage in "Hamburger Concerto" The music's quality on this record is really good and sometimes I'm surprised they are outtakes. Especially if you like the Focus from 1973 (Focus II &amp; 3) you will appreciate this album.
