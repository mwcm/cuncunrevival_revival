   The band was established in London in 1966, when Riki Maiocchi of I Camaleonti fame decided to create a new band to explore the new opportunities brought about by the advent of psychedelic rock. In London, Maiocchi had met with Ian Broad, who joined in Maiocchi's project; they also recruited Ritchie Blackmore (on guitar), Arvid "Wegg" Andersen (bass and vocals) and William Gray (also on guitar). The band debuted in Italy as "Maiocchi and the Trip". Blackmore left in December 1966 and returned to London where he continued as a session musician until 1968 when he joined Deep Purple. He was replaced by Luciano Galdolfi. When Gandolfi, Maiocchi, and Broad left, new and fundamental additions were made to the personnel, namely Joe Vescovi (keyboards) and Pino Sinnone (drums).

   In 1970, the band (who had been renamed "The Trip") signed for RCA Italiana, releasing their first, eponymous album. At the time, progressive rock was still not clearly defined as a genre; The Trip is in fact a rather traditional rock and blues album. Also in 1970, the band was featured in a surrealistic Italian movie by the title Terzo Canale: Avventura a Montecarlo.

   With such a name and such a title, you can easily imagine which type of music this Italian band is playing. Pure psychedelic glory of course!

   And I have to say that it is quite enjoyable to the ears of yours faithfully. Totally early Floyd oriented, this album is sung in English (when vocals apply).

   The opening number, which is an instrumental, is a highlight of this album. More A Saucerful Of Secrets oriented I would say: it is demoniac psychedelia from the good old days. With "Incubi", the band gets back a bit more in time, and the sound is more "Piper" oriented. Instrumental passages are quite well performed but the vocal parts are not that great (but this is general remark as far as I'm concerned).

   "Visioni dell'Aldilà" is a weird track in its early stages (but Roger said about ASOS that it couldn't be called a "song"; so?). Vocals are better than usual; but there is no structure in this song. Themes are changing all the time: so be prepared for quite an experience! What a ride!

   At a certain moment ("Rifflessioni"), the band doesn't seem to know in which direction they want to go. This song is a pitiful melting pot of several influences (mainly pop, boogie, AND decadent music).

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The closing number is a childish pop/psyche song which sounds quite outdated (but hey! This was released in 70). All in all, I quite like this album.
