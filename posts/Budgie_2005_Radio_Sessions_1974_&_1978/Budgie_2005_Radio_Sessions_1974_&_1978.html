  I bought the old "Heavier Than Air / Rarest Eggs" release some time ago and wasn't sure whether to buy this one to get the few extra 1974 tracks - I'm very glad I did. The 1978 gig serves as the live album Budgie never released at the time - a well recorded great performance which no Budgie afficionado could be disappointed by, other than missing the odd classic tune such as 'Napoleon' (and 'Breaking All the House Rules' taking a slightly over-enthusiastic tempo). Being 'remastered' has not made a revolutionary change in sound compared to the previous release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1974 tracks sound much better than the two tracks included on the earlier CD. The recording meets the quality of a very good bootleg: it's from a good desk mix but is hissy and with occasional tape dropout. This latter causes the odd unscheduled drift in panning &amp; the occasional increase in background noise. There are fades in the applause and announcements between some tracks and 'Hammer and Tongs' fades just before the end. However, it's a fantastic performance, it flows from track to track and has real atmosphere and energy: I'm more than delighted I bought it.
