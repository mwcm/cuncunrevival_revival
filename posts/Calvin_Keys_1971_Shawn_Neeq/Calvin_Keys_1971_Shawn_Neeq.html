    Originally released on the influential label Black Jazz in 1971, guitarist Calvin Keys' debut is a stone classic waiting to be re-discovered. The funky, deep grooves and Calvin's singular guitar stylings, coupled with a heady collaborative feel that inhabits so many early '70's jazz recordings, are all on beautiful display. 40 years later, Tompkins Square proudly re-issued this LP on 180g vinyl just in time for Calvin's 70th Birthday (February 6th, 2012).

    This is a gratifying, if a little tentative, first outing for Oakland guitarist Calvin Keys as a bandleader.  Recorded for the Black Jazz label, it has all the elements of “rare groove” you would associate with that imprint, with lots of modal jamming and solos that push oh-so-slightly to the outside.  Larry Nash on the electric piano is particularly good, and there are some exciting and bewildering sounds from Owen Marshall, credited here on flute, “hose-a-phone,” and “miscellaneous” – he was known to invent his own instruments. Whatever is screeching and squalling on the opening track B.E. sounds like a violin at times, but probably isn’t.  A chimerical character behind one of the seriously collectable independent and private press jazz records from the early and mid-70s (Captain Puff In The Naked Truth), you could say Owen Marshall is this record’s secret weapon.   Drummer Bob Braye doesn’t quite hold the rhythm together in a way that I’d like, unless that tense feeling of just barely keeping it from falling apart was actually his calculated approach.  One exception is the funk groove of B.K. (Burger King?) in which he keeps everything in the pocket and nails it there for nine minutes.

    All in all, a solid record, but for me it’s really a prelude to his second release on Black Jazz, titled Proceed With Caution, which surpasses it in every way.  With any luck, that might well be my next post here.  Also, Calvin Keys may have kept a low profile throughout his life but he is still around, and released a record in 2013 called ‘Electric Keys’ (Wide Hive Records) which is definitely worth checking out!

    Calvin's musical roots originate in his hometown of Omaha, NE, playing with legends like Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson. Shortly after the release of his debut LP 'Shawn-Neeq', Calvin was hired to tour and record with Ray Charles. By the mid-70's, Calvin was working steadily with pianist Ahmad Jamal on the road and in the studio. Since settling in the Bay Area in the mid-70's, Calvin has recorded numerous solo albums and played with many greats, including Taj Mahal, Bobby Hutcherson, Big John Patton and Dr. Lonnie Smith. In 2007, fellow Midwesterner and big fan Pat Metheny included the song "Calvin's Keys" on his album, 'Day Trip'.

    "Calvin Keys is a world-class jazz guitarist -- and more. The 70-year-old Bay Area resident has worked extensively with Ahmad Jamal, spent a couple of years in the employ of Ray Charles, and held his own in the fast company of Joe Henderson, Pharoah Sanders, Sonny Stitt, Red Holloway, and many others. Pat Metheny saluted him with an original composition called 'Calvin's Keys,' found on his album Day Trip. For decades, Keys has evidenced considerable facility and conviction as a blues player, too. Back in the soul jazz 1960s, he was in organ trios led by such blues-savvy notables as Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff, Charles Earland, and Brother Jack McDuff. Always open-minded, the native Nebraskan has even worked with Luther Vandross and MC Hammer. To date, Keys has made 11 albums under his own name. One of the most radiant is his debut, Shawn-Neeq, originally issued in 1973. The album came in the wake of the soul jazz era when Miles Davis' startling shift into a Sly Stone-informed electric-jazz swept over musicians and hip listeners like a tsunami. Thanks to the Black Jazz label, Keys did his part in delivering good Miles-influenced jazz-funk to record buyers, music that has aged surprisingly well. Throughout Shawn-Neeq, Keys' guitar shows him to be a close stylistic ally of two guitarists with a similar soul jazz pedigree: Grant Green and George Benson. His pentatonic, bluesy riffs and occasional 'outside' sounds grace songs based on riffs or chords. The man plays with control and confidence." --Frank-John Hadley, Downbeat; Personnel: Calvin Keys (guitar), Bob Braye (drums), Lawrence Evans (bass), Larry Nash (electric piano), Owen Marshall (flute, hose-a-phone, misc.)

    Jazz guitarist Calvin Keys is a legend among soul-jazz fans for his appearances as a session musician and his small catalog of releases under his own name. Known for his lean, muscular single-string solo style, Keys was born in 1943 in Omaha, Nebraska. His first musical influence was his father Otis, a well-known drummer on the city's music scene. He passed the music bug on to Calvin, who picked up the guitar early. Keys eventually landed his first notable gig as a member of Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson's band when he was 17. He first hit the road with sax player Little Walkin' Willie during his that same year, before moving on to Kansas City. There his first gigs were with Preston Love (of the Count Basie Orchestra) and later the Frank Edwards Organ Trio. After woodshedding with Edwards, he landed a spot in organist Jimmy Smith's road trio. After leaving Smith, Keys worked the rest of the 1960s with Jimmy McGriff, Jack McDuff, and Richard "Groove" Holmes.

    Keys moved to Los Angeles in 1970. In 1971, he signed to Gene Page's fledgling Black Jazz label and cut his debut album, the now legendary Shawn-Neeq. He gigged on his own before auditioning for the Ray Charles Orchestra.Keys' unique phrasing and his ability to balance sophisticated jazz harmonics with tough R&amp;B and soul grooves were showcased nightly in the Charles band. In 1973, Black Jazz released Keys' second offering, Proceed with Caution. He toured briefly before being snapped up by Ahmad Jamal. Keys spent the next seven years with the pianist, recording six albums and touring the globe.

    By 1975, Keys had relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he became -- and remains -- an avid participant in its jazz community. He worked in live settings and recording sessions with John Handy, Bobby Hutcherson, Eddie Marshall, Leon Williams, Bob Braye, Ed Kelly, Eddie Duran, Bruce Forman, Junius Simmons, and Eddie Moore. In 1976, he played on Doug and Jean Carn's Ovation album Higher Ground. The 1980s proved similarly fruitful; Keys was an in-demand studio and live sideman, with credits including appearances with Tony Bennett, Pharoah Sanders, and Sonny Stitt. Keys began recording another solo album in 1984. In 1985, Olive Branch Records released tracks from these sessions as the album entitled Full Court Press; it was followed a year later by Maria's First.

    Keys continued playing sessions and performing with touring acts in the Bay Area and the occasional Los Angeles gig. In 1991 he was part of the band that recorded film composer James Newton Howard's original score for the film Dying Young. Working with his own trio, Keys released Standard Keys on Lifeforce Records in 1992; his session and live work continued at a relentless pace, which eventually took its toll. Some of his work included reuniting with Jamal for the pianist's 1994 album Night Song for Motown's MoJazz imprint, and a tour of Europe that resulted in Jamal's Live in Paris 1996. An Evening with Calvin Keys, taken from a radio broadcast, was released that same year.

    He was sidelined in 1997 by heart surgery, undergoing a quadruple bypass. Undaunted, he released the widely acclaimed Detours into Unconscious Rhythms on Wide Hive Records. The large cast included organist Chester Thompson (Ray Charles, Santana) and upright bassist Kenneth Nash (from Jamal's band). After the album's release, Keys toured regionally in the U.S. and in Europe before returning to the Bay Area, where he performed with organists Big John Patton and Dr. Lonnie Smith, and Taj Mahal. In 2005 Keys recorded Calvinesque for Silverado. The album hit number 30 on the jazz charts.

    His second Wide Hive release, Vertical Clearance, was issued in 2006. It reunited Keys with Doug Carn, and included Phil Ranelin, Sonny Fortune, Roger Glenn, and Babatunde in its lineup. In 2007 Keys released Hand-Made Portrait on Silverado, and received a tribute from fellow Midwesterner -- and fan -- Pat Metheny, who composed and included the tune "Calvin’s Keys" on his album Day Trip.Keys appeared on Ranelin's Living a New Day for Wide Hive and on organist Gloria Coleman's Sweet Missy for Doodlin in 2009. In 2012 Tompkins Square Records re-released Shaw-Neeq exclusively on 180-gram vinyl. Keys supported it by touring with a band, performing the album in its entirety. AMG.
