   Here is a rather mixed bag from Tyner.Side 1 features some of his best work as a solo artist and the two tracks are challenging powerful numbers that reflect the changing styles in jazz at the end of the sixties.Tyner and Bobby Hutcherson are amazing together and the music is like a more muscular version of Hutcherson's work on Andrew Hill's Dialogue i.e bloody good.There is of course a huge difference in the piano however as McCoy bashes the hell out of his keys especially on the epic opener "African Village".Side 2 on the other hand features one Tyner original and three standards and the pace and experimentation is tined down.It is not bad and still pleasant to listen too but misses the fire in its belly that makes the opening two tracks so breathtaking.

   Time for Tyner finds pianist McCoy Tyner with vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, bassist Herbie Lewis, and drummer Freddie Waits. Tyner and Hutcherson blend together quite well on the first three tracks from the original program (all Tyner originals), and both display expertise at coming up with inventive ideas over modal vamps. The other three selections are veteran standards. "I Didn't Know What Time It Was" is taken by the full quartet, Hutcherson sits out on "Surrey with the Fringe on Top," and a rhapsodic "I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face" is a piano solo. A fine all-round showcase for McCoy Tyner in the late '60s.

   McCoy Tyner, Being my favorite pianist, his music has provided me with endless enjoyment ever since I became a "real" jazz fan. This album, "Time For Tyner" is exactly what I'm referring to. I have always been impressed with McCoy's skill as a composer, honed more than likely during his time spent with Trane. I've noticed that he always pulls the best out of his personnel, regardless of the set up. A great quartet setting here with no horns is the perfect backdrop for McCoy's wizardry. The originals he penned for this album are amazing, all killer and no filler. Vibist Bobby Hutcherson complements McCoy perfectly, while Freddie Waits and Herbie Lewis on drums and bass respectively swing as well. The opening original track "African Village" is utterly amazing. Pay close attention to the synergy of this lineup. Incredible! A mandatory addition to the Tyner catalog, "Time" is as good a RVG reissue as there is out there!
