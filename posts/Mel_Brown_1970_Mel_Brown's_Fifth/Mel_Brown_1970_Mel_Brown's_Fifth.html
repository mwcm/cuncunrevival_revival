  Back to the blues based guitar licks and the funky grooves, some blowing horns and jazzy improvisational parts &amp; funny looped endings on both sides of the lp, really good stuff!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MEL BROWN learned the guitar while fighting against the meningitis when he was a kind. He spent hours and days to follow his father's footsteps and play the Blues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He began his musical career as a musician for Bobby Bland and released his first LP in 1967 on Impulse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He doesn't play "regular traditional old-fashioned Delta Blues" but a contemporary blend of Soul Blues where you can find, piece by piece, most of his influences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Luv Potion" is the last track on side one, a 10+ minute instrumental that gives a good idea of how this album sounds like : it's soulful, bluesy, jazzy and hot!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not to mention the absolutely awesome gatefold cover...
