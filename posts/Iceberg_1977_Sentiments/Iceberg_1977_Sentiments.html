   After the superb Coses Nostres, how can one follow up and still appear as on top of their game? Iceberg found the easy (but not so obvious) answer, to make another superb album, and believe me they did. The album actually veers a bit more jazzy in the fusion sense sometimes approaching the over-demonstrative Return To Forever or even a bit Weather Report and still the better Santana (Caravanserai) and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Some moments are so powerful that I cannot help but thinking of Journey's superb jazz-rock debut album with the incredible Ainsley Dunbar on drums.

   Right from the opening title track, you know this album will strike all the rights chords if you like the above-mentioned bands, and the Spanish feel is present but nothing obtrusive (hardly any flamenco hints, but more of Rodrigo (Aranjuez) feel. Again Sunyer and Mas take the stage by storm, but the rhythm section is really on top of its game. The only small gripe I might have is that the synths sounds are a bit more "modern", but at least on this album they have been correctly reproduced during the CD transcript. To separate one track and raise it above the rest is simply impossible to this reviewer, because the album is incredibly even, with maybe Magic a bit under par. However, if I must name just one track, listen to the closer Alegries Del Mediterraneo.

   A smoking album, just as excellent as the previous Coses Nostres but better rated because of no avoidable sound flaws. Among my top 40 jazz-rock albums,

   Another incredible example of Jazz / Fusion from this Spanish band. Their previous album "Coses Nostres" along with this album are really must-haves for Fusion fans out there. They're one of those bands where each member is outstanding on his instrument and isn't afraid to show it.

   "Sentiments" opens rather quietly as sounds come and go seemingly in the background. It's building though until the guitar comes to the fore after a minute. "Andalusia; Andalusia" opens with electric piano followed by some scorching guitar. Chunky bass and pounding drums follow. The keys and bass sound great 2 1/2 minutes then the guitar comes in. He's lighting it up a minute later. "A Sevilla" opens with piano and the sound eventually gets fuller. The guitar stars to solo before 2 minutes then the synths take the lead. Back and forth between the guitar and synths the rest of the way. You need to check out the keyboard / drum intro on "Ball De Les Fulles". Fat bass and guitar follow. It settles after 2 minutes, electric piano comes in. Themes are repeated.

   "Magic" opens with the sounds of dogs carrying on. They don't sound like real dogs though (haha). A funky beat takes over and it stays funky throughout. Synths and guitar come and go. "Joguines" calms down quickly with acoustic guitar before a minute. Piano, bass and drums help out as well. "Alegries Del Mediterrani" is my favourite track. It reminds me of MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA especially the atmospheric sections. Drums to open then it settles with that atmosphere. Deep bass, drums and electric piano are outstanding here. The tempo picks up after 3 minutes then the guitar joins in. Piano replaces the guitar 4 minutes in as the bass and drums impress big time. The guitar and piano continue to trade off. It settles again 6 1/2 minutes in. Amazing ! More guitar after 7 minutes as drums pound. This is really incredible.

   I highly recommend this album from ICEBERG and the previous one as well.
