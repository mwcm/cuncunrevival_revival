  Official vinyl pressings:
  <br/>
  1975: First pressing with Blue center labels &amp; kangaroo. Track A1 is credited to Broonzy on back sleeve and center labels. Later copies had the side one label changed to correct an error in the writing credit for "Baby Please Don't Go". It was incorrectly credited to Broonzy, but was actualy written by Joe Williams - The matrix number is the same, and the label still carries the Blue Roo, that is used by Alberts, to signify an original Alberts issue. Track A1 is still credited to Broonzy on the back of the sleeve, but Joe Williams is now credited on the side one label. (these are a lot less common than Broonzy - at a rate of around Three Broonzy to one Joe Williams, which is also a good indicator that this is not a different issue).
  <br/>
  1977: Blue center labels with no kangaroo.
  <br/>
  1980: Black center labels
  <br/>
  1981: Red center labels with yellow border. Made in New Zealand. Track A1 is credited to Broonzy on back sleeve and center labels.
  <br/>
  1983: Red center labels without border. Writings all around the center labels.
  <br/>
  1987: Red center labels without border. Writings on the top half of the center label. Track A1 is credited to Broonzy on back sleeve and Joe Williams on center labels.
  <br/>
  1989: Red center labels without border. Writings on the bottom half of the center labels.

   Malcolm Young, who has died aged 64 after suffering from dementia, was the driving force behind AC/DC, the rock outfit that sold more than 200m albums over 40 years to become one of the highest-grossing bands of all time. His brother Angus, the band’s lead guitarist, may have been the most recognisable character in AC/DC, largely thanks to his habit of wearing school uniform on stage, but it was Malcolm whose inventive rhythm guitar and storming riffs formed the backbone of the band’s sound. Malcolm often took the crucial decisions about the band’s strategy, and he became notorious for abruptly firing various managers, producers and band members.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   AC/DC rocketed into rock’s front rank with the release of Highway to Hell in 1979. Its swaggering juggernaut of a title track encapsulated everything that would make AC/DC great. Bass, drums and crushing guitar chords created a roaring bulldozer of sound, enhanced by Angus Young’s molten soloing, while the lead singer Bon Scott howled soulfully overhead. Disaster threatened the following year when the charismatic Scott died from alcohol poisoning. They came back with their next album, Back in Black (1980), featuring a new vocalist, Brian Johnson. It bristled with such powerhouse tracks as Hells Bells, You Shook Me All Night Long and the title song, and was a defiant statement of intent that sold more than 50m copies.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981) was another smash, and AC/DC’s first US chart-topper (a feat they wouldn’t repeat until Black Ice in 2008). The title track became a regular encore piece in AC/DC shows for decades to come. All three of these albums were produced by Robert John “Mutt” Lange, a Zambian-born British songwriter and producer who went on to work with Def Leppard among others, and they formed the core of the AC/DC legend.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Malcolm was born in Glasgow, the seventh of the eight children of William Young, who had been an RAF mechanic and a spray painter but became unemployed in the 1950s, and his wife, Margaret. The family lived in the Cranhill housing estate until 1963, when William and Margaret emigrated with six of their children to Sydney via the Australian government’s “ten pound pom” scheme (adults paid £10 each for the fare while children travelled for free).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It was George Young, six years older than Malcolm, who first enjoyed musical success, as co-founder of the Easybeats, the so-called “Australian Beatles” who scored international hits including Friday on My Mind (1966). Finding the family home besieged by Easybeats fans influenced Malcolm and his younger brother Angus to form a band of their own. Malcolm cut his teeth with early groups including Beelzebub Blues, and developed an assured guitar technique influenced by Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix as well as Santana and Stevie Wonder. Angus, meanwhile, practised furiously to become a virtuoso lead player.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The brothers, neither of whom was much over five foot tall, assembled the first version of AC/DC in November 1973, with Dave Evans as vocalist. When Scott, another Scottish immigrant to Australia, replaced Evans the following year, the band released their first album, High Voltage (1975), produced by George Young and his Easybeats songwriting partner Harry Vanda. “With Bon, that’s when the band became a band,” said Malcolm. “We had a real character with his own style and his own idea for lyrics.” Those lyrics were primarily concerned with sex, drugs, drink and rock’n’roll.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The drummer Phil Rudd and bassist Mark Evans then joined, and played on three further albums, T.N.T. (1975) – featuring their early favourite It’s A Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock’n’Roll), Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976) and Let There Be Rock (1977), before Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams for Powerage (1978).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1976 the band signed a deal with Atlantic Records and were soon recognised as an influence on British rock bands including Saxon and Iron Maiden, while also being bracketed with punk by the British music press. “We were always saying: ‘We ain’t a punk band, we’re rock’n’roll,’” said Malcolm. “But it was good that punk came along and changed the face of music for a while.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After their albums with Lange, AC/DC – led by Malcolm – decided they wanted a simpler approach, but Flick of the Switch (1983) and Fly on the Wall (1985), both produced by the brothers, were lacklustre efforts. Who Made Who, the soundtrack to Stephen King’s film Maximum Overdrive (1986), mixed old and new material and put the band back in the charts, while Blow Up Your Video (1988) continued the good work by selling a million in the US.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As the band prepared for the Blow Up Your Video tour, however, Malcolm announced he needed a break to deal with a worsening alcohol problem. “It caught right up to me and I lost the plot,” he admitted. “Angus was going: ‘I’m your brother, I don’t want to see you dead here. Remember Bon?’ So I took that break and cleaned myself up.” His place on the tour was taken by a nephew, Stevie Young, son of their oldest brother, Stephen.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Malcolm was back for the next album, The Razors Edge (1990). Produced by Bruce Fairbairn – renowned for his work with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi – it swept AC/DC back to multiplatinum glory, selling 5m copies in the US alone. The Razors Edge tour produced an acclaimed live album, Live, though when 1995’s Ballbreaker appeared it was AC/DC’s first new material for five years. A further half-decade passed before they released Stiff Upper Lip (2000), a solid though uninspiring effort.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   While their new material dwindled, their back catalogue remained hugely profitable. In 1997 they released the five-disc set Bonfire, featuring studio and live material. In 2002 they signed with Sony Music, which reissued expanded versions of their past albums. Plug Me In (2007) was a multi-DVD package comprising rare live footage. The band also licensed tracks for use in the Rock Band series of computer games.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 2003 AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The album Black Ice (2008) confirmed their status; it debuted at No 1 on album charts in 29 countries, and achieved global multi-platinum sales. During the ensuing 20-month world tour they played to more than 5 million people in 28 countries.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 2011 Angus spoke of plans for a new album, possibly to mark the band’s 40th anniversary in 2013, but Johnson told US radio it would be delayed because of an unnamed band member’s health issue. In April 2014 AC/DC’s website announced: “Malcolm Young is taking a break from the band due to ill health.” It was rumoured that Stevie might once again stand in for his uncle. Malcolm’s elder brother George died last month aged 70.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Malcolm is survived by his wife Linda, daughter Cara, son Ross and brother Angus.

   AC/DC didn’t start coming to the attention of fans around the world until the international release of High Voltage in April 1976. But back home in their native Australia, the group was already well-established stars, having begun their “Long Way to the Top” on Feb. 17, 1975, with the release of the original, domestic version of High Voltage. Today, this album sounds like a rather pale imitation of the “Thunder From Down Under” to be captured on the band’s better known, globally released LPs. But hey, everybody has to start somewhere.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And for AC/DC, the start came in November 1973, when siblings Malcolm and Angus Young decided to follow in their family’s strong musical tradition -- older brother George had found stardom with the Easybeats; another brother, Alex, enjoyed great success with several groups -- and join forces instead of competing against one another with different bands. Choosing their name on the suggestion of sister Margaret, who would later convince Angus to don his school uniform onstage, the fledgling AC/DC cut their teeth on small stages while working through a succession of band members behind singer Dave Evans. And with the advice and support of the well-connected George, by July 1974 they had inked a deal with Sydney’s Albert Productions and released their debut single, “Can I Sit Next to You, Girl,” before deciding that Evans wasn’t the right man for the job.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So by September, Ang and Malc had kicked him to the curb and hired a charismatic singer named Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott — just in time to take over Albert Studios and record AC/DC’s first album, with the multi-talented George on bass and production duties (alongside his former Easybeats partner Harry Vanda), while Tony Currenti beat the drums. Indeed, not until after the album’s release in the new year would AC/DC’s first true rhythm section of bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd make their mark, so the use of session men definitely contributed to the unfamiliar qualities of the original High Voltage. Well, some of them, but not all ...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tellingly, the most explosive song the band could conjure up in the studio at this early stage in their development was not its own, but a cover of Big Joe Williams’ “Baby Please Don’t Go.” But boy did they let it rip, delivering one of the all-time definitive renditions of the oft-covered tune (it's certainly the most violent, even more so than Ted Nugent’s version), which also doubled as their set opener for much of those first few years. While some band originals -- like “Soul Stripper,” “Show Business” and the grinding “She’s Got Balls” (Bon’s tongue-in-cheek tribute to wife Irene) -- showed occasional glimpses of AC/DC’s iron-clad future template, the Youngs evidently hadn’t yet learned how to harness and then unleash their full sonic power.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Today, everything is Rock or Bust in the world of AC/DC, but other High Voltage tunes were another matter entirely, with “Stick Around” and “You Ain’t Got a Hold on Me” both lacking all that much energy, and “Little Lover” being a surprisingly limp leftover from the band’s short lived glam rock days. And then there’s “Love Song,” which broke every blue-collar rock 'n' roll rule the quintet would live and die by in the years ahead with its distracting keyboards, saccharine melodies and sappy romantic lyrics, showing tough guy Scott as you’d never imagine (or want to). Just as surprising and indicative of the work-in-progress that was AC/DC, the LP finds Malcolm handling lead guitar for parts for “Little Lover,” “Soul Stripper” and “Show Business,” having not yet completely handed off such responsibilities to baby brother Angus.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All this being said, AC/DC’s onstage antics were already becoming the stuff of legend, and, at least until future albums overshadowed it, High Voltage performed very well upon release, climbing all the way to No. 7 on the Aussie charts and fueling the band’s exhaustive promotion schedule across the country until the release of their even more successful sophomore album, T.N.T., in December 1975. Together, these two Australian long players provided the songs that the rest of the world would come to know as High Voltage in its second edition from 1976, but of course that amazing collection would have never been possible without the modest first steps undertaken on its lesser known, like-named predecessor.
