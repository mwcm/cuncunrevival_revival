   A dreamy sax solo soaring from a delicate acoustic guitar pattern announce a new dawn... "Dawn, you are rising / There is no noise into the air / Dawn, you are spreading your colour / And you are calling me / My heart is opening / I feel that I am changing / Yes, I feel it, I'm changing...". The opener "Alba" is a beautiful track that could remind the early Alan Sorrenti's album, but it also one of the few moments that could be of interest for a prog lover. Another excellent track is the sparkling "Sienteme", featuring nice bass lines and beautiful vocals, and lyrics in Neapolitan dialect. On the album there is also an English version of this song, "Listen To Me", with a different and less interesting arrangement.

   The rest of the music contained on this album is very different from the early works of this artist. The album was recorded in the U.S.A., it's sung almost completely in English and it has a definitively pop sound. The songs are simple and melodic, there's almost no room left for experiments and the voice is no more a daring and bold instrument. Nonetheless I don't think that this album is really a treason. Alan Sorrenti was completely fed up with the atmosphere and the politic climate that surrounded the music business and the social life in Italy. He was looking for a new dawn, a new musical direction. Songs like "Try To Imagine" and "Your Love Is Magic" clearly show this direction... The days of disco music were just behind the corner.
