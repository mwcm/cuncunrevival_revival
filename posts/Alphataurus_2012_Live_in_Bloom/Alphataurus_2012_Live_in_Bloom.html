   Alphataurus are a band that would have been lost to obscurity, were it not for their tight musical display and resulting cult fanbase. Although they only put out one complete record in their time (as well as one incomplete, and substantially less acclaimed sophomore) Alphataurus are a staple for any self-respecting fan of Italian prog rock. Considering that the band's heyday was 1973 and little has been heard of them since then, it's quite an event to have them return, even if it's only in the form of a live recording.With word of a new studio album on the apparent horizon, it's indeed exciting to have this band back and running, although for its own merits, "Live In Bloom" does not add much more to Alphataurus than we have heard in the past.

   All things considered, it is very impressive to hear this band still in such tight shape after nearly forty years since their pair of albums came out. Of the six musicians playing here (at the 2010 Progvention, an Italian festival) three of them are original members of the band. There is not a single 'weak' point to the group's performance here, however. While this is recorded in a live venue, the performance is tight and clear to the ear. Considering that poor, muffled recording is an annoyance that plagues a great many live albums, it's great to hear "Live In Bloom" executed with such clarity.

   The song selection itself is precisely what one would expect from an Alphataurus set; encompassing the entire debut album, whilst plucking a couple of picks from the "Dietro l'Uragano" record as well. The music is very consistent in its quality, though while I found myself in a constant state of awe towards the bands tightness and relatively technical take on the 'symphonic' style of prog rock, I cannot say that any part particularly stood out, or captivated me as a highlight of beauty. Granted, I'm not greatly familiar with Alphataurus' studio work, but the performance feels like a fairly reproduced rendition of what's on the album itself. In other words, the performance rarely seems to take a life of its own, and that's often what separates the good from the great when it comes to releases like this.

   "Live In Bloom" certainly gives Alphataurus fans something to be excited about, and though their talent and skill are still as bright as ever, I'm not left seeing the band's music much differently. Regardless; it takes some incredible skill to perform music of this style and calibre in the live setting, and Alphataurus do not disappoint.

   One of the great surprises of recent years for fans of Italian prog was the reformation of Alphataurus who released one highly regarded album nearly 40 years ago and then split leaving an unfinished second album, later released in the unfinished form as Dietro L'Uragano. The reformed Alphataurus features 3 original members and Live In Bloom, taken from a show in 2010 is the first recorded output of the new 6 piece line-up.

   Live in Bloom features their entire first album with a couple from the second - Ripensando E... and Valigre Di Terra. Alphataurus put on an impressive performance showing they have lost none of their chops as they rip through the seven compositions, mainly symphonic prog along with the bluesy hard rock of Dopo L'Uragano. For a while new vocalist Claudio Falcone had me fooled that he was original member Michele Bavaro, his performance faithfully replicating his predecessor at times. The excellent recording and slick performance with vintage keyboards intact make this album a must for fans of the band.
