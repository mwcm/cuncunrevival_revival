   Eric Kloss was only 17 when he recorded his second Prestige LP, Love and All That Jazz, in 1966. At that age, most jazz musicians are lucky to be featured on an album as sideman, let alone record as a leader and have a contract with an independent label of Prestige's stature. When other teenage jazz musicians were playing in high-school bands, Kloss was working with heavyweights like Richard "Groove" Holmes and Don Patterson (both of whom are featured on this vinyl LP). It was the sort of story that a publicist would love to pitch -- blind teen-age jazz prodigy from Pittsburgh plays with "Groove" Holmes when he isn't old enough to vote. But Kloss wasn't a novelty; he really did have impressive chops, and the saxman brings a great deal of confidence and conviction to Love and All That Jazz (which employs Holmes or Patterson on organ, Vinnie Corrao or Gene Edwards on guitar, and Billy James or Grady Tate on drums). Although Kloss (who is heard on both alto and tenor) could handle jazz-funk and modal post-bop, hard bop was really his forte -- and passionate, hard-swinging bop is exactly what he delivers on the Thelonious Monk-influenced "Just for Fun-k" (a Kloss original) and performances of Cole Porter's "Love for Sale" and Miles Davis'"No Blues" (as opposed to "All Blues"). But not everything on this record is up-tempo. Jimmy Dorsey's "I'm Glad There Is You" is a soulful example of Kloss' ballad playing, and the saxophonist is equally expressive on a seductive, Brazilian-influenced version of Johnny Mandel's "The Shadow of Your Smile." Although Kloss was still a teenager in 1966, there is nothing adolescent about Love and All That Jazz.
