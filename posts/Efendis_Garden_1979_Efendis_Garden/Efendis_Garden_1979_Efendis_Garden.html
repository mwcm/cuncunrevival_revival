   EFENDI’S GARDEN was – despite of their exotic musical sound  - a band from Hannover. Founder Wolfgang Krantz formerly played with the bands called JANE and HARLIS, then he took a year off, to make a terrific return in 1979 with EFENDI’S GARDEN. Activated by the former bandmember of JANE, Klaus Hess, as well as bassplayer Frank Meier, drummer Wolfgang Schreiner, Saxophone player Heinz Alberding and the uncommon singer Thomas Stender, Krantz presented a collective which had to search one’s own kind in former musical aera of West Germany. Arabian singing, amplified by a megaphone, between shrill and hypnotic but always very intensive joining the slick arranged music. Partly like a soft ballade then again hardrock sound á la best JANE-tradition – even disco elements (it was the big disco fever at that time) are to be heard and are integrated into the musical concept. Pure relief – for this band normally all doors would have been open for future business – allthemore the live gigs built real hightlights, due to the optical appearance of singer Thomas Stender alias Curtis Efendi. But he lived in West Berlin thus no constant tours/rehearsals could take place.

   1989 EFENDI’S GARDEN came together again, reason was an appearance in the Capitol, Hannover. 1990 they entered the Peppermint studios with new song-ideas where finally 10 titles have been recorded but never appeared on a sound carrier. (This changed with the cd you have in hand, all songs have been added as bonus tracks because they really are perfect examples for great rockmusic). After the recording session the band unfortunately dissolved.

   Klaus Hess still is on tour with MOTHER JANE, Wolfgang Krantz belongs to the actual cast of Peter Panka’s JANE. Both vinyls of HARLIS „Harlis“ and „Night Meets The Day“ have been re-released in 2009 by Sireena Records.
