  1965 - Their First Recordings -  is an EP of Pink Floyd music, containing songs recorded in 1965 by the band. It was released as a limited edition set of two 7" vinyl records to extend the copyright of the recordings. This is the only official release featuring guitarist Rado Klose and Juliette Gale, Richard Wright's first wife. This release consists of the earliest Pink Floyd recordings available commercially, with five original songs written by Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, and one Slim Harpo cover.

  Simply wonderful. Charming. Rocking too. "Remember Me" is pure garage thrash. "Double O Bo" is a bit of a dud but the rest of it is going to change your life. I was a douchey sack of gaywad until I heard these tunes and now I'm out there kicking sand into the faces of wimps. My aim is true!
