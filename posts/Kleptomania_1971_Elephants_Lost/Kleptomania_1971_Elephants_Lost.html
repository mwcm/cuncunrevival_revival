  One of the better albums from Belgium in the 70's.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herman Brood became very popular in Holland at the end of the 70's, one part was pumped up media hysteria and one part were his ''live'' shows. He played in every shithole in Holland and  as a result of the   extensive touring he gained chart-succes. Danny Lademacher [guitarist Kleptomania] was part of his band. As a result of the attention in the Dutch media a demo-tape once sent to FLAME Records, was given to a recordshop owner  who in the past had released a 45 under the name of ''Bag'' on  FLAME Records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was impressed by the demo and deceided to press a bootleg LP , It went for sale under the counter in his recordshop. He hoped to sell them quickly but it took more than 10 years to sell them.
  <br/>
  I ferquently visited his shop in those years because  critics who wrote for music magazines dumped their promo/advandced albums there and he sold them for bargain prices. Just as he got rid of the boots in the early 90's , Internet/Ebay started  and he saw the demand for the album rising. But he had none left ! This album (1972) was only released as a very hard to find bootleg (300 pressings) (1979)
  <br/>
  due to a failure of the record company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their music can best be described as a sound close to Led Zeppelin , Byrds (Younger Than Yesterday period) and Montrose.  Included are Moonchild , Mean Old Man,Kept Woman, Rock and Roll...and yes...a Byrds cover: So you wanna be a rock and roll star...This very limited edition has the whole album plus 4 singles,b-sides , demos and unreleased tracks too.
