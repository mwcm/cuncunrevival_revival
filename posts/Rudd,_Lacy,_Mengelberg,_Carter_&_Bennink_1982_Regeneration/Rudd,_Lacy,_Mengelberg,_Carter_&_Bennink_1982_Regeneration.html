   Combining three eccentric compositions by Herbie Nichols and three by Thelonious Monk to form an album just makes sense.  It's 40 minutes of fantastic, weird grooviness.

   Steve Lacy is the most famous member of the band and easily among the great soprano saxophonists in Jazz history.  He had also been play Monk's music for a couple decades before this.  Pianist Misha Mengelberg is probably the most famous after that.  That's not to say that the drummer and bassist aren't good.  They are excellent and versatile.  What I enjoy the most about the album though is how confident and boisterous Roswell Rudd is on the trombone.

   In 1982, very few people were aware of late pianist Herbie Nichols' name, much less playing his music. Versatile avant-garde pianist Misha Mengelberg gathered together a noteworthy group (comprised of trombonist Roswell Rudd, soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy, bassist Kent Carter, and drummer Han Bennink) to play three songs apiece by Nichols and Thelonious Monk. The musicians very much understood the composers' purposes, and on such numbers as "Monk's Mood,""Friday the 13th,""Blue Chopsticks," and "2300 Skiddoo" (the latter two had never been recorded with a group larger than a trio before), they come up with definitive treatments. Highly recommended.
