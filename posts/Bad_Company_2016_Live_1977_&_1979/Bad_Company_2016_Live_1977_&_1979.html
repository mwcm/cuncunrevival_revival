   Hum, I can only wonder how much of my high school and college career was spent listening to Bad Company albums ...  My grades probably would have been substantially better had some of that time been devoted to studies.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When released in 2016, "Live 1977" was marketed as the first-ever official live album featuring the original band line-up.   2006 had seen the first Bad Company album - "Live In Albuquerque", but that project died a quick death after it became tangled in various legal issues.  Anyhow, live Bad Company is exactly what you got on this fifteen track, double album set.  Recorded at a May 23, 1977 performance at The Summit in Houston, Texas, this was prime Bad Company.  Touring in support of their new "Burnin' Sky" album it shouldn't have come as a surprise the set list included a heavy dose of then-new "Burnin' Sky" material.  By my count, six of the performances were from the new album (the title track, 'Too Bad', 'Heartbeat', 'Morning Sun', 'Like Water', and 'Man Needs a Woman').  The rest of the set featured a mixture of deep cuts and their hits.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For an album that wasn't treated to any post-production fixes (assuming you believed the credits liner notes), the results were quite impressive.  Exemplified by tracks like 'Leaving You', 'Too Bad', and 'Heartbeat' Rodgers and company came across as a band that was totally profession; confident with their talents.  Yeah, 'Ready for Love' and a couple of  songs came off as slightly rawer than the studio versions, but with the exception of 'Morning Sun' the stripped down performances were uniformly killer.  In fact, my only complaints were minor.  Opening side three, Kirke's drum solo was a needless waste of space that would have been better allocated to another hit, or an obscure performance.  And as much as I love the hits; perhaps because I've heard them so often, part of me wished there'd been a wider selection of obscurities.

   The CD version of the collection included an additional 14 tracks recorded at a March 9, 1979 performance at London's Wembley Stadium and a cover of 'Hey Joe' drawn from a June, 1979 Landover, Maryland Capitol Center concert.

   Page five of the booklet that accompanies Bad Company’s long overdue Live 1977 &amp; 1979 double compact disc set showcases a color concert photograph of the popular English blues rock group that defines the seventies. Taken from the side of the stage, the photo showcases Bad Co treading the boards below a bright spotlight, while wide-eye fans lean on the edge of the stage, taking in the tight group’s performance during their prime. The cool shot captures the interplay between the classic Bad Company line-up of all-world vocalist Paul Rodgers, guitarist Mick Ralphs, bassist Boz Burrell and drummer Simon Kirke, and their star-struck admirers. Further proof that a picture is worth a thousand words, and the seventies fucking ruled.

   Signed to Swan Song Records, with heavy-handed manager Peter Grant in their corner, Bad Company released their self-titled debut LP in 1974, and subsequently blazed a trail throughout the seventies, releasing an album each year, sans ’78. When not in the studio, the group was a touring machine. Like so many acts from the stoned-age seventies, the demanding record-tour-record cycle took a heavy toll on the collective members of Bad Company.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It has always amazed me that during the super seventies, when the live album was a staple of virtually every group on the scene, Bad Company never dropped down an official concert recording. 1978 was there for taking, as the group took their time following-up on the March of ’77 release of Burnin’ Sky. With Desolation Angels, the group’s fifth studio LP, following two years later, Bad Company could have easily filled the ’78 void with the release of an in-demand live recording.

   2016 finally witnessed the official release of Bad Company’s May 23rd, 1977, performance at The Summit in Houston, Texas. After years in the can, the tapes from the Houston show during the sold-out Burnin’ Through America Tour of ’77 were mixed in 2016 by Richard Digby Smith and mastered by Jon Astley, and are showcased on disc one of the Live 1977 &amp; 1979 collection. Billed as 100% live with no overdubs, the previously unreleased recording kicks in with Bad Company leaning on the inspired title track from their 1977 album. “Too Bad” chases the intro track, with “Ready for Love” squeezed in before a string of four songs from Burnin’ Sky monopolize the front end of the set. “Shooting Star” dominates mid-set, while the touring anthem “Movin’ On”, plus the closing trio of “Live for the Music”, the upbeat “Good Lovin’ Gone Bad” and the swagger-in-spades “Feel Like Makin’ Love” stand out from the fourteen song set.

   Disc two presents Bad Co during one of their rare late ‘70s UK dates. Touring on the strength of the Desolation Angels LP, Live 1979 is pulled from the group’s date at the Wembley Arena, in London, on March 9th, 1979. The outlaw inspired “Bad Company” fronts the set, which is chased by the Burrell penned “Gone, Gone, Gone”. As expected, the ’79 set showcases a wealth of tracks from Desolation Angels in addition to the lively “Gone, Gone, Gone”. Following “Shooting Star”, Bad Co roll out the swingin’ “Rhythm Machine”, the moody “Oh, Atlanta” and “She Brings Me Love” from the ’79 LP, as well as adding “Evil Wind” and the popular “Rock ‘n’ Roll Fantasy” later in the performance. The defiant “Run With the Pack”, the striding “Rock Steady”, the ever-present “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and show closer “Can’t Get Enough” anchor the set. Lifted from a summer of ’79 gig at the Capitol Center in Washington, DC, Bad Co’s cover of “Hey Joe” is spliced between “Rock ‘n’ Roll Fantasy” and “Feel Like Makin’ Love” as a show of heavy duty Jimi Hendrix respect from Ralphs and company.

   Better late, than never, the long, long, long wait for classic era Bad Company official concert recordings has been well worth the wait.

   The long awaited "official" Bad Company live album gets released decades after their heyday as an arena band in the US. Not really surprising as they've gone from being an arena band to a classic rock radio staple.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Great sound, great track list and solid performances. The only negative is that neither show is complete. They trimmed songs from both sets to fit them onto one disc each and to minimize duplicating songs on both discs. There is some duplication, but it's kept to a minimum. Nice packaging too, lots of pictures and info about band.
