   This is the album by which we hold the end of MO's first line-up's end. Indeed, recorded just like the previous two albums in a rush (four days in late June 73), Hammer and Goodman opposed to its release, this time being helped by Laird, usually not choosing sides between the two camps, while McLaughlin and Cobham wanted to release it as such. So for once, Mc had not his way in his project, which was a first, another being that three tracks of this album are not from him. Indeed the other three come from the rebellious camp. Those having seen MO in concert always noticed that this was John's ship and he was alone boss on it, which in the long run was not a good idea. A mistake he would repeat with the MkII line-up as can be evidenced on the Montreux Performance. Anyway, Columbia finally stumbled on the tapes (that had migrated from London to LA) and released the album with the group's (full, I think) consent, and what a brilliant idea it was, but I just wish they would've given, it a more project-type of artwork instead on this relatively cheap photo montage.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Starting on the gigantic epic track called Dreams, the album quickly lets you climb aboard the spaceship returning to 73, so much easier so that the track exists inan extended version of the live BNaE album. It would be pointless to start picking the differences here, but I like the studio better, due to better recording conditions. The following Trilogy is also a track that has graced the Live 73 album, and here we get in full force with a much-needed conciseness, quality lacking in the live album.

   Among the new tracks heard for the first time is the particularly superb Goodman-penned I Wonder, which has a slight déjà-entendu descending riff, but the track is so very lovingly enamouring that it could last twice its length. The Rick Laird-penned Steppings Tones is an ascending riff being worked upon to great affects, but like Goodman's composition, it's fairly repetitive. But most interesting is the Hammer-penned Sister Andrea, a very accomplished track that concentrates not only one Hammer's keyboard work, but allows a full spectrum of the group's possibilities. Most likely Hammer's Czech origins made him most likely to pull some Stravinsky-like songs that John Wanted for MO, and Sister Andrea is this album's highlight. Closing up the album is a fantastic version of John's Song #2, and shows the unbelievable power this group had and the mastery in their restraint from exploding their powers all over the sonic spectrum, Goodman's violin again underlining magnificently the rhythm section, yet allowing itself all the space to expand. Clearly the group was still quite together back then even if a spat between John and the rest of the group (with Cob abstaining, thinking of his own album to come Spectrum) about writing credits has etched the varnish.

   A posthumous album that I wouldn't file anywhere else but sandwiched between BoF and BNaE, LTS is a pure gem that every MO fan simply must have. Just as difficult not to give it a full rating as with its shelf neighbours

   Almost 30 years after its original recording, producer Bob Belden came across the master tapes of what would become The Lost Trident Sessions. Belden had been working on the remastering of Birds of Fire when he discovered these tapes, and the rest is history (so to speak). At long last, the aborted final studio effort of The Mahavishnu Orchestra saw the light of day.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Since this studio effort was never finished, the live Between Nothingness and Eternity was released instead, featuring several numbers from the failed recording sessions. McLaughlin apparently felt the studio efforts had not been fully realized. In hindsight, he was probably right. After all, if the vibe wasn't right and he was less than pleased, so be it. But just because McLaughlin didn't think the sessions were up to his usual standards doesn't mean they don't bear interest. They sound great and have historical significance. That's justification enough for their delayed release.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Apparently all of the old band members were contacted and asked for permission to release the recording, warts and all. This was probably done as a courtesy from Belden, because as far as any one can tell, the musicians had absolutely no control over their Columbia Records output anyway.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At any rate, The Lost Trident Sessions provide us with the future direction of the MO. That is, the band was about to break up. This is evidenced by three tunes penned by members other than McLaughlin. Jan Hammer's piece "Sister Andrea" may be familiar from Between Nothingness and Eternity. Jerry Goodman's "I Wonder" and Rick Laird's "Steppings Tones" [sic] also appear. In addition, the Trident Sessions feature the McLaughlin originals "Dream,""Trilogy," and "John's Song #2." Both "Dream" and "Trilogy" are also included on BN&amp;E , while "John's Song #2" is new to McLaughlin's recorded output.

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "John's Song #2" is the album's standout. It serves as a precursor to the style to be heard on the new Mahavishnu Orchestra's Visions of The Emerald Beyond a year later. The rapid-fire starts and stops and ever-changing themes make it a fusion treasure. It also serves as a particular showcase for Goodman. His violin soars here to much greater heights than on his earlier efforts.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The tighter versions of tunes from BN&amp;E are welcome. "Trilogy" in particular is a taut composition which would later be fleshed out on the live album. Hammer's "Sister Andrea" sounds pleasing and includes enough distinction to render it distinct from the live performance. Hammer's soloing is also more impressive on the studio effort.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "I Wonder" and "Steppings Tones" present a problem. Both tunes are somewhat simple, but catchy. Although enjoyable, they just do not belong on a Mahavishnu Orchestra album. One can understand the musical tension developing at the time after listening to these two cuts. In fact, strict Mahavishnuites would also point a crooked finger at Hammer's "Sister Andrea," which gives early indications as to where the fusion movement was moving. Unfortunately, it was moving out of touch.

   The most surprising aspect of the recording is the fine, up-front performances from Goodman and Laird. We all knew by this time how great McLaughlin, Cobham and Hammer were. Laird and Goodman, although clearly talented, seemed earlier to be along for the ride. This recording corrects that misconception in a big way. Both players make strong statements, and surprisingly, these statements do not appear on their own compositions. Listeners who still seek to validate Laird's playing should step back and appreciate "One Word" from Birds of Fire.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The sound quality is great given the fact that these tapes were gathering dust for all those years.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Lost Trident Sessions is an important historical find that contains some awesome music, and it also gives some hints as to why the band was running into problems. The record is a must for any fusion fan; critics who insist on dismissing its quality or importance should be court-martialed post haste!
