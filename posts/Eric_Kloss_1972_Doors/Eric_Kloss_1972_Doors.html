    Eric Kloss: Past And Prescient

   The latest album in the racks by saxophonist Eric Kloss isn't new at all. Entitled "Doors," it was recorded in 1972 at a pivotal point in Kloss' career. At the time he was moving away from the confines of post-bop structures and beginning to experiment with freer forms and different styles. "Selective electicism" is how he described it.

   Kloss has since gone on to make his mark in jazz as an individualistic and adventurous musician and composer. But "Doors" reveals the saxophonist first spreading his wings, and a dozen years later the music still holds up.

   The album opens with the title track, paying homage in 9/8 time to poet William Blake's "doors of perception." Muted keyboards, over-dubbed horn duets, spacious silences and a recurring figure in the bass create an entrancing, rather impressionistic effect. our other tracks (or "doors") bear similarly apt one-word titles: "Waves" is an idyllic retreat, carefree and alluring; "Quasar" has enormous collaborative energy; "Love" is part sentiment, part emotion; and "Libra" balances two over-dubbed tenor saxophones of differing musical temperaments -- one jazz, the other rock.

   Because a conceptual album like this requires a cohesive and intelligent group effort, Kloss was fortunate to have pianist Neal Creque, bassist Gene Taylor and drummer Ron Krasinski along for the ride. Kloss' playing on alto and tenor saxes is often striking and always sensitively executed, but the individual and collective contributions of his fine rhythm section consistently add to the album's enduring appeal.
