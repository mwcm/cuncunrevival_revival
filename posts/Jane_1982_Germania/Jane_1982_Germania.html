   "Jane" is again a trio for this album. Their shift into the "heavy prog" genre (from Eclectic) is maybe deserved when you listen to the title track. One of their heaviest rock song. Rather convincing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But this will be the mood of this album. "Rock And Roll Revolution" is fully reminiscent of "Born To Be Wild". A great hard to heavy rock anthem. A highlight.

   This German band has had very little weaknesses in terms of album releases. They deserve a serious applause for this. Their offering will not always be great of course, but just remember which type of music was released by the giants in those days (1982).

   It is a pity that Pedja who took over the vocals on their previous album is not there any longer. His decadent type of vocals fitted perfectly well "Jane's" music. He added such a special atmosphere that I really miss him here.

   Most of the songs art purely rock songs. Energy and hardness are on the menu.

   Almost, I should say because "Jane" already demonstrated some chameleon skills with their previous album. Being more new wave oriented than anything else. No wonder then that "Get Back To You" has a DEEP reggae style.

   The only negative comment would be that in those days (1982), this style was kind of outdated in Europe.

   "No Future" has nothing to do with the "Pistols" revolutionary anthem. This song is just a heavy, very heavy blues/rock song. Not my cup of tea, but not bad either. "Jane" has been able to avoid a poor rating from my listening and it still will be the case with this one.

   This is of course another "Jane" (but their previous album also showed a new sound) and even if the end of this album is not really strong : "I'm So Down" and "Driving Me Crazy" are indeed heavy rock songs and don't have any relation with prog. They belong more to the post-punk period actually. Same sort of "garage" sounds for the last two songs from this album.
