   Japanese jazz veteran bassist Hideto Kanai started playing jazz in US Army bases after WWII. Later during 60s he switched from mainstream to free and together with other celebrity guitarist Masayuki Takayanagi founded the Jazz Academy in 1960. Surprisingly during his half of a century-long career on scene Hideto recorded only four(!) albums as leader, all on legendary Three Blind Mice label.

   "Q" is his debut release, and the album which made him famous around the world. Actually, four quite free compositions aren't all that different from that what Japanese advanced jazz of the time has been offering. Just time was great for innovative artists and almost every album, released by best country's musicians during early 70s is at least good, often really great.

   Ten-pieces Hideo Kanai Group, formed for the recording, contained some leading artists of the time(incl.Masayuki Takayanagi on guitar,Mototeru Hino on drums and Kosuke Mine on alto sax among others). Album's opener and closer(two longest album's compositions)are pre-composed by two contemporary Japanese classical composers Shuko Mizuno and Hiroshi Nanatsuya specially for this release. Both sounds still quite free though, even if one can hear some classical structure and elements here.Two other short songs are just free improvs.

   Kanai-led combo doesn't sound as orchestra - all music is build on Eric Dolphy's tradition of hard-bop backup with different artists free soloing over it,changing one another. Revolutionary for the time of release, this music dated well and today sounds as free jazz classics.
