     The ARMS Charity Concerts were a series of charitable rock concerts in support of Action into Research for Multiple Sclerosis in 1983. The first (and initially planned to be the only) event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on September 20, 1983, with subsequent dates occurring in the United States, with slightly different lineups of musicians

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     The idea for hosting the concert was envisaged by Ronnie Lane, ex-bassist for The Small Faces and The Faces, himself a casualty of multiple sclerosis. The concert was billed as The Ronnie Lane Appeal for ARMS and featured a star-studded line-up of British musicians, including Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood, John Paul Jones, Andy Fairweather-Low, Bill Wyman, Kenney Jones and Charlie Watts. The concert was particularly notable in the fact that it was the first occasion on which Clapton, Beck and Page, each a former lead guitarist for The Yardbirds, had performed together on stage.

     Pretty good set from Beck and Page no real Meat and Potatoes from Clapton. Beck Focuses on his Material from the mid to late seventies. No tracks are any better then the Studio Classics. As for Page Prelude and Who's to Blame with Winwood on vocals are priceless. Jimmy is wasted but far outplays the studio versions without a bad note. The rest of his set is sub par with City Sirens and A sloppy stairway to heaven. I expected better from Clapton but this was a week stage in his career and it shows.

     And lets talk about the huge white elefant in the room that always is avoided when people talk about these shows. Jimmy Page is obviously in an advance state of heroin addiction. Well, at least it should be obvious -- wake up, people! He's not merely rail thin here, but emaciated, and he visibly stumbles around the stage. His behavior is at times quite strange, and you can see the discomfort on Eric's face -- having been through this himself, he clearly knows what's going on. Some people have commented on him merely being a bit sloppy, but I'm just surprised he didn't drop dead right then and there. I always suspected Page would have been shocked at his appearance if he'd seen the footage, and it turns out, it's said that he was. Supposedly, it was a big catalyst for him to finally get cleaned up.

     All flaws included, I must say non of it mattered back on September 20, 1983 when as a teenager I sat full excitement next to the radio at insane o'clock listening to the show, and reliving those moments weeks and years after listening to the tape a friend of mine made from the US Westwood One radio show at the time. So, play it loud, it's not perfect, but it's still a great show.
