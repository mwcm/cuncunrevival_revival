   The title track to this album, for me anyway, is one of Pharoah Sanders finest recorded moments. It's like the most mellow, soulful, heart warming and beautiful pieces of music you could ask for. This track is the musical equivalent of the big fat hug, and will not fail in lifting your spirits. Unfortunately the rest of the album is quite forgettable and quite an obvious sign of Pharoah Sanders floundering around looking for musical direction. As "Love Will Find A Way" is the only track worth having from here, don't bother with this album, just treat yourself to the magnificent Soul Brother Records compilation Anthology: You've Got to Have Freedom . That album is a faultless collection of Pharoah Sanders tunes, and along with tons of other great stuff, "Love Will Find A Way" is on there in full un-edited glory, and my personal high-point on the album.

   A beautiful little record by Pharoah Sanders – quite different than most of his other recordings of the 70s, and done in a smoothly jazzy mode that also features plenty of soul! Sanders did the set in collaboration with Norman Connors – and the style is in that same great mix of mellow soul and deeper jazz that Connors used on his own brilliant records from the time. Instrumentation includes some keyboards and guitar mixed in with Sanders' always-soulful work on sax – and a number of cuts have vocals, either by a chorus shading in the tunes, or by Phyllis Hyman in the lead. The whole thing's great – warmly soulful, and almost a tighter extension of the modes that Sanders was exploring on his last album or two for Impulse.
