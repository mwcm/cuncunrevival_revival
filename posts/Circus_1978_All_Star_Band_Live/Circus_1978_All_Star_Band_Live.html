   Recorded live at the Volkshaus Zurich and the Hotel National Berne on january 26th and 27th 1978 with the "Maison Rouge" Mobile Studio London. Mixed at Sinus Studio Berne. Written on cover: "The tracks on this album are excerpts from the concerts we did with the All Star Band in Zurich and Berne 1978. These concerts have been a first step to improve the communication between Swiss Pop-, Rock- and Folkgroups. We hope you enjoy the music as much as the Circus All Star Band enjoyed performing it."

   ''Live'' was a 2-days show by Circus and a collective of Swiss artists with Pop, Folk and Rock backgrounds in an attempt to unite forces from different musical paths.Although the music is definitely lighter and less haunting than Circus' normal albums, it's the Circus spirit that dominates this release, offering interesting Prog/Rock with some psychedelic extensions and jazzy colors, especially in the two 10+ min. tracks, interrupted only occasionally by some poppy flashes.Unlike the previous Circus albums, there is lots of room for electric guitar along with the standard sax intervetions and organ runs.And there is a fair amount of frenetic Van der Graaf Generator-like Prog to be found, showcasing that Circus never actually quit from being a highly intricate group.
