   Recorded on 18th May 1968, “Miami Pop Festival” is a single CD of the performance given by The Jimi Hendrix Experience at the Miami Pop Festival. This CD was released in November 2013 although I suspect bootlegs have been available for years. And it is very well put together by Experience Hendrix – the family run concern that supposedly protects Jimi Hendrix’s legacy. Good sleeve and booklet.

   Except and it’s a big except, having read a review by Freewheeling Frankie on Amazon, the CD is not exactly what happened on May 18th 1968.

   The Miami Pop Festival was unusual because each act was scheduled to play 4 times – twice on the Saturday and twice on the Sunday. Sadly the Sunday was washed out, but The Jimi Hendrix Experience did play two shortish sets on the Saturday – afternoon &amp; evening. Now, the CD would have you believe that it contains all of the evening set together with two “bonus” tracks from the afternoon – “Fire” and “Foxy (spelt “Foxey” here) Lady”. This is apparently nonsense.

   The afternoon set was “Tax Free”/”Foxy Lady”/”Fire”/”Here My Train A-Comin”/”Purple Haze” and the evening show was “Hey Joe”/”Fire”/”I Don’t Live Today”/”Foxy Lady”/”Red House”/Purple House”. The CD says the evening show was “Introduction/Hey Joe”/”Foxey Lady”/”Tax Free”/”Fire”/”Hear My Train A-Comin”/”I Don’t Live Today”/ “Red House”/“Purple Haze”. This means that only one of the versions of “Purple Haze” –probably the evening show version according to Freewheeling Frankie – is on the CD and the other “Purple Haze” could have been included. There is more than enough space on the CD.

   I feel that Experience Hendrix have rather messed up this release and given that details of the actual sets are not that hard to find, I can’t see why they would pretend it was otherwise.

   Oh well! What is the music like? Very good actually. The Experience – Jimi Hendrix – guitar and vocals, Mitch Mitchell – drums and Noel Redding – bass and backing vocals are on very good form although it is on the longer, more experimental pieces, rather than the hits where Jimi is at his best. Don’t get me wrong – both versions of “Fire” &amp; Foxy Lady” are great as are “Hey Joe” and “Purple Haze” but the really good stuff are “Tax Free” – written by Bo Hansson (best known for his concept album “The Lord of The Rings”) &amp; Janne Carlsson – and it’s an instrumental, an early version of “Hear My Train A-Comin’” and a 12 minute version of “Red House” which is worth the price of this CD. Terrific stuff.

   So, “Miami Pop Festival” is a very good live album and the sound quality courtesy of Eddie Kramer is great. There are better live Jimi Hendrix Experience albums - but “Miami Pop Festival” is worth having. Just a shame that the producers did not issue the two sets as Jimi Hendrix played them.
