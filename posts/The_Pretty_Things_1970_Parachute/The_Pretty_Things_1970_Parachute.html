   1970 was a year of massive releases, and it was a notable time for heavy genres rising from the ashes of 60s' psychedelia. Some bands didn't choose any one distinctive sound on their path but made a vibrant mix of all their influences, and for me the greatest of these bands were The Pretty Things.

   1968's S.F. Sorrow is a wonderful album, but in my opinion it feels somehow incomplete and lacks the raw energy The Pretty Things are known for. The difference can be heard between some of the tracks' album versions and the performances found on BBC Sessions. But then came Parachute. It shows a soft, harmonious side of the band as well as the dangerous, loud one. Whereas S.F. Sorrow is a concept album telling a man's life story, the themes in Parachute include love, uncertainty, alienation, the human nature and violence.

   The instrumental Scene One sets an ominous mood for the album, but instead they continue on a streak of soft, beautifully arranged tunes. The Good Mr. Square and She Was Tall, She Was High form a two-part song with a perfect transfer in between, and the pair is one of the absolute highlights. Then we get to Rain. From there it's all sharp, melodic guitars and driving drums and bass lines. Miss Fay Regrets is what rock'n'roll is about for me. Its howling guitars burst out sounding almost uncontrollable. Cries From the Midnight Circus plummets into a darkness that most of their colleagues seemed to lack.

   Grass is also one of the highlights of the album. The lyrics are melancholic, poetic and kind of distant. The fleeting yet beautiful intro turns into one of my favorite guitar riffs ever that's backed by simple bass and drums. This time the solo guitar is soft, warm and melodic.

   Sickle Clowns tells a story about violence, inspired by the ending of the controversial movie Easy Rider. It feels like an angry sibling of Cries From the Midnight Circus. The unexpected percussion solo near the end of the track is great.

   Along with the ending trio of Neil Young's On the Beach, the last three tracks are among the greatest ways to end an album. She's a Lover is a supersonic delight for the ears. Once again the guitars and drums work together beautifully, and the hazardous solo guitars kick in unexpectedly in the middle. What's the Use is a short, achingly beautiful track with great vocal harmonies. It starts with an echoing, simple piano riff that sounds like the first rays of light on a cold winter morning.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Then we get to the stunning ender, the title track Parachute. It starts with ethereal vocal harmonies, subtle guitars and bass, until the drums kick in and everything flows seamlessly into the divine middle part with bells and, yet again, achingly beautiful guitars. Then a driving piano riff leads us towards the end, when the track ominously, suddenly dies down and all that's left is an oscillating note that rises high to the skies, sounding like a massive alarm siren. The listener is left sitting on the edge of the seat waiting for more, listening closely. What now? The listener waits, but all that's left is overwhelming silence.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As a summary, Parachute is absolutely one of the greatest albums ever made. It's dark, melodic, innovative and full of beautiful arrangements. Parachute is beauty and sadness wrapped into one - and The Pretty Things' finest hour.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   S.F. Sorrow is the Pretty Things' Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and Yellow Submarine wrapped in one, then Parachute is their more succinct White Album and Abbey Road. It's not just a time line comparison. The Pretties made this fascinating LP in the same studio as the Fab Four, London's Abbey Road, with Beatles engineer Norman Smith producing. "The Good Mr. Square" replicates the three-part harmony the Beatles were so proud of on "Because." Two songs later, the group assembles a brief, interconnected three-song suite like the famous ones on side two of Abbey Road. Bassist Wally Allen's vocals on tracks such as "Sickle Clowns" have the same throaty, mad anguish that John Lennon exhibited on "Yer Blues" and "Happiness Is a Warm Gun." If S.F. Sorrow is hard rock grandeur, then Parachute is its more bitter twist, the dream dying and the witching hour upon us. Yet, if this isn't as much of a triumph, the creative neurons are still firing throughout a multi-varied, cohesive LP. Like S.F. Sorrow, it's a surprisingly palatable concept LP. This time the topic is a generation caught between the conflicting calls of (rural) peace, love, and boredom, and (urban) sophistication, sex, and squalor in a harsh world. Somehow the departure of the band's main creative force, Dick Taylor, didn't diminish the writing and inspired variety. Allen stepped up big time into the collaborator role with singer Phil May. The harmonies remain a strong point on an otherwise rock-inclined record, and the nasty edge of perfectly balanced bombast in the best songs have been a lost art ever since.
