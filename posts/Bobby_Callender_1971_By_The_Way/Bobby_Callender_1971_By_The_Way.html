    I only have the 2002 re-release, so I have always wondered how the 2002 release compares to the original one... what got left out, or what got condensed into one track etcetera, etcetera... (The original 1972 LP is a Double, the Akarma LP only has three sides) if anyone out there has any idea, or a rip from the LP I would surely appreciate a copy. Having said that, lets continue todays proceedings!

     Bobby Callender's second offering is a similarly lush and psychedelic slice of late-'60s/early-'70s mysticism. Again, the listener is transported into a hazy, opium den world of spoken word poetry and David Axelrod-inspired production. The Way follows the self-explorative travels of 'John', the album's protagonist, as he discovers the meaning of love, life and happiness. Be prepared for a number of references to serene meadows, matriarchal sunlight and transcendental harmony throughout. While, generally speaking, the vibe here is very similar to Rainbow, there seems to be less of an emphasis on sitars and Eastern sounds than before. Perhaps his overtly Christian offering, "Let Thy Will Be Done," is an explanation for this. Regardless, this time the overall feel of is more All Things Must Pass than Wonderwall. Collaborators on this highly recommended set include producer, Alan Lorber and members of Oregon.

     An orchestral and eastern influenced psychedelic pop gem, Bobby Callendar’s “The Way” sometimes gets the shaft to “Rainbow,” but I like “The Way.”

     Sometimes, when folks are asked if they could interview anybody from any time, it would be Gandhi. But, The Rising Storm chooses Bobby C. Seriously, somebody needs to get the scoop on this mysterious and intriguing record. Bobby’s intense lyrics are matched with a mix of eastern instruments, lush strings, and tambourine. I can’t say why but the tambourine sticks in my memory. Nothing says 60s pop like that wonderful percussion instrument.

     Bobby C. was clearly very into the Mike Love style 60s eastern Buddhism thing. “Sitting ‘neath the bodhi tree… as one.  The Story of Rasha &amp; Dhara is essential listening for psychedelic music fans. It’s pretty, and strange, and sports one of the smoothest basslines of the 60s.

     Not to say that this record is flawless. There are a few skippable tracks, all in all it’s nothing to brag about, but there are some real nice gems in here. The opening is miraculous, while others are catchy, and others take you quite by surprise. Be prepared for religous themes and a generally trippy experience.

     During the late 60's, Bobby Callender was one of the most mythical figures in popular music. Conceptually his musical universe delivers all the originality of an artistic freedom, really awakened of alternative lifestyle, cross cultures and psychedelic "civilization". Callender is an afro American who turned to mystic and reaches himself into Indian raga, philosophies from the East. The two albums he recorded under his name ("Rainbow" in 1968, "The Way" in 1971) are currently seen as the two logical sides of a grandiloquent project including numerous musicians from the jazz and raga scenes. Among the featured musicians we can quote the famous "India raga style" guitarist Collin Walcott. Bobby Callender composes almost all titles and make some recitations. "Rainbow" released in 1968 is a fantastic effort, really amazing, played freely with numerous dialogues between sitar and tabla, with subtle adds of violin, piano and bass (electric). The main elements of composition are the rhythm, very structured, complex and the improvisational jazz / "raga" which introduces us in a spiritual and floating psychedelic atmosphere. The two albums are really conceptual, developing short, esoteric tales mostly served by basic themes of eastern instrumentations and odd, spoken words. Bobby Callender's musical signature is a perfect illustration of free form "ethnic" jazz improvisations in adequacy with the growing effervescence of the 60's "acid", psychedelic philosophies.
