  Throwing back to 50 years ago April 1968, I was working on my first solo album “The Sidewalk” with my trio. I was very excited about my continuing adventure in music after I started to play the guitar 11 years before (which was in 1957). I selected and arranged the songs and composed 3 songs for the album. I still remember the moment I heard one of the songs on the radio for the first time while I was driving in my car. What a feeling of joy and delight!
  <br/>
  The photo on the album cover was taken at the intersection of Sunset Blvd and Clark St in front of the “Whiskey A Go-Go” in Hollywood, sitting on the sidewalk at 6am :-)
  <br/>
  The blue suit I have on was tailor made in Japan which I had just returned from a concert tour there in January. The photo on the back side was taken in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles.

  I do not own David T. Walker's second album, and the 2nd hand cd's are pretty expensive, so I wonder if anyone has a digital copy of it to share with us?
