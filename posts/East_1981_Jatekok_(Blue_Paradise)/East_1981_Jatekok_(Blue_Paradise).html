   First of all, this one comes courtesy of childhood friend Leonardo Beulens, the guy that introduced me to Iron Maiden, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Marillion and all things horns... If you are ever in Havana and looking to expand your musical collection with some true local rarities, this is the guy you need to find, he will amaze you with his vast and arcane knowledge on Rock, Pop, Latin, Jazz and god knows what more, I have known the guy for almost four decades and he still manages to introduce me to bands I didn't know (all that while living behind the Sugar Cane Curtain!). Anyhow, the other day we were chating on Facebook and asked me if I knew these guys while showing me his copy of the album... I did not... He insisted that I should check them out... and since Google is also my friend, I became hooked on these dudes... Thank You Bro!

   EAST is one of the most beloved prog acts from Hungary (if not the most). While the rest of the world was into New Wave, MARILLION carried the prog torch for Great Britain and points west. Guitarist János VARGA, keyboardist Géza PÁLVÖlGYI, singer Miklós ZARECZKY, bassist Péter MÓCZÁN and percussionist István KIRÁLY decided to pick up the prog banner for Eastern Europe.

   In 1981, they released their debut album "Játékok." The English translation is games. Oddly, they did release an English version, but it was titled "Blue Paradise." It was a well-received debut, and is still highly regarded. However, it is the sophomore effort, 1982's "Hüség" (Faith), that seems to capture more hearts.

   The first two albums were more symphonic inspired, but they felt the need (or perhaps pressure) to pursue a more mainstream approach. This led to replacing lead singer Miklós ZARECZKY, with József TISZA on "Rések a Falon" (Cracks in the Wall). While the third album is not the darling of prog fans, it was a great commercial success. The next outing, 1984's "Az Áldozat (Szodoma)" (The Victim (Sodom)) saw them dumping vocals altogether. It is completely instrumental, and has been described as a rock ballet. This could also be considered the last true EAST studio album. There was a four-year gap until "A Szerelem Sivataga" (The Desert of Love) came to be, and everyone except Péter MÓCZÁN had left the ranks. It is also interesting that this album enlisted the biggest lineup (eight in all) to bear the name EAST.

   Another nice entry in the list of good East-European  Prog Rock bands, East were a band from Hungary, formed in mid-70's in Szeged and led by charismatic guitarist János Varga.However the band should have to wait 5-6 years before releasing their debut.This would come in 1981 under the title ''Jatekok'' (Start, translated into ''Games''), certainly in a harsh time to produce sophisticated Rock music.Except Varga, East were Péter Móczán on bass, István Király on drums, Géza Pálvölgyi on keys and Zareczky Miklós on vocals.Though some of the bass lines and keyboard parts will remind you of Marillion, these guys achieved to release two albums before Marillion released even one.The style of the music lies somewhere between Symphonic/Melodic Rock and Space Rock with heavy use of electronic samplers.Yes, the two first tracks are very close to Marillion, but as the album unfolds the band deliver a very personal style of Prog Rock.Part of the guitar work will remind you of Alex Lifeson's style in late-70's/early-80's Rush, a few rockin' passages pop out here and there, some Fusion elements are added for a change and the electronic parts create some great soundscapes for the listener.This is a very challenging mix of sounds by a band with a rather dark-sounding atmosphere.This one deserves your attention, for it carried the torch of Art/Prog Rock at a time, when experimentation was more than forbidden for a band's survival.

   Nice album of this Hungarian Band. A fine Progressive style with keyboards and very nice guitar arrangements. Lot's of spacey parts that made a very good instrumental context. A good band of East Europe when we can find a little of Pink Floyd and a little of Camel. The drummer is in a classic neo-prog vein, with a nice intricate part's. The vocal parts are very nice but is in Hungarian and we do not understand the message of lyrics but they are very harmonic in this prog style. I think that this album and specially, the 3 first albums of this band, are a very good addiction of a Progressive collector, specially a East Europe band in Iron Curtain time, because rock is prohibited. Very good musicians in a hostile environment, that create a very nice album that we must to hear with care, valuing the context in which it was create. I like this album and this band and I give 4 stars because the arrangements and the high quality of the musicians, they are worthy. A good album for the East Europe Prog Fans.
