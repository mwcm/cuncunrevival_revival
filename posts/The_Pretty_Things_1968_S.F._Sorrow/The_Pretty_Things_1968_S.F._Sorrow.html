   Who could ever have thought, going back to the Pretty Things' first recording session in 1965 -- which started out so disastrously that their original producer quit in frustration -- that it would come to this? The Pretty Things' early history in the studio featured the band with its amps seemingly turned up to 11, but for much of S.F. Sorrow the band is turned down to seven or four, or even two, or not amplified at all (except for Wally Allen's bass -- natch), and they're doing all kinds of folkish things here that are still bluesy enough so you never forget who they are, amid weird little digressions on percussion and chorus; harmony vocals that are spooky, trippy, strange, and delightful; sitars included in the array of stringed instruments; and an organ trying hard to sound like a Mellotron. Sometimes one gets an echo of Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn or A Saucerful of Secrets, and it all straddles the worlds of British blues and British psychedelia better than almost any record you can name. The album, for those unfamiliar, tells the story of "S.F. Sorrow," a sort of British Everyman -- think of a working-class, luckless equivalent to the Kinks' Arthur, from cradle to grave. The tale and the songs are a bit downbeat and no amount of scrutiny can disguise the fact that the rock opera S.F. Sorrow is ultimately a bit of a confusing effort -- these boys were musicians, not authors or dramatists. Although it may have helped inspire Tommy, it is, simply, not nearly as good. That said, it was first and has quite a few nifty ideas and production touches. And it does show a pathway between blues and psychedelia that the Rolling Stones, somewhere between Satanic Majesties, "We Love You,""Child of the Moon," and Beggars Banquet, missed entirely. [This CD reissue on Snapper adds four valuable songs from their 1967-1968 singles ("Defecting Grey,""Mr. Evasion,""Talkin' About the Good Times," and "Walking Through My Dreams"). This version of "Defecting Grey" is the original, long, uncut five-minute rendition, and not of trivial importance; it's superior to the shorter one used on the official single.]

   The magnificent S.F.Sorrow is as problematic as it is triumphant, mostly due to its lofty ambition and a four-track recording machine and compounded by the inexplicable decision to release it in stereo despite the liner notes assuring us that it's here "in pure, original and glorious mono". I've never heard the mono mix but I'm sure I would have preferred it and I'm suspicious about four-track recordings, intended for mono, being remixed in stereo. Sorry to go on but S.F.Sorrow is a seminal work and needs carefully looking after.

   Everything that is essential to early British psychedelic rock is to be found here and the experimental, kitchen sink approach is almost a philosophical one. Was there ever a time when recording was as much fun as in the late 60's? The joy of discovery shines through, compare it to, say, Dark Side of The Moon. There's something about the risks of throwing stuff and seeing what sticks that thrills in a way the more considered approach often cannot. It's still risky though, and this is a major undertaking that could have ended up a sorry mess and it has its problems (some laid all the more bare by the stereo mix) but it's so well written and goes to so many places that it easily overcomes any of its shortcomings.

   The Pretties make psychedelic magic from a range of styles anticipating heavy metal, stadium rock, folk rock, even progressive rock itself. Its inpenetrable story line is a little obscure but it immediately opened up the possibility of the concept album to the wide-eyed proteges that would carry forth the progressive banner.

   It's hard to understand why this brilliant album went unnoticed by the larger public at the time and it's fascinating, now, to see how this, and other great music, is re-emerging in the digital age, reincarnated, as it were, no matter what its past life. A recognition perhaps, of how unique rock's golden age really was, or a last ditch attempt to exploit its rapidly ageing fan-base....?

   But let's not get too cynical, if you have a taste for 60's British psych and you're unaware of this one then prepare to be amazed. Let's be grateful that The Pretty Things believed in themselves enough to push the boundaries of their own music, they may not be the progressive virtuosos but through the strength of their ideas and convictions they transcended their R&amp;B roots and pointed the way to the future. Psychedelic bliss!
