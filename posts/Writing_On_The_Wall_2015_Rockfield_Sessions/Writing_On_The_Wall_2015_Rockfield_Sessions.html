  “Writing on the Wall” were a Scottish psychedelic/progressive rock band from 1967 until 1973. Continually on the road for six years- everything from radio, TV, British &amp; European tours, recording and of course Brazil. One of the very few bands to have held two residencies at the famous Marquee Club in London. The band issued but one official studio album, the 1969 release ‘The Power of the Picts’. Like many evolving groups caught in the midst of rapid musical evolution in the late sixties, WRITING ON THE WALL retained much of the blues influence of the music they came of age with by mixing heavy and sometimes uneven blend of psych, blues with idealistic and often abstract lyrics to form a distinctly late sixties sound reminiscent of groups like BLUES IMAGE, CACTUS, and BABE RUTH. Writing’s music tended toward a more somber tone than most of their peers, and the band further distinguished themselves by relocating to England to make somewhat of an impression on the British scene of that day. The band recorded for DJ John Peel in late 1968, and released their sole album on Brian Waldman’s fledgling Middle Earth label. Waldman also served as the band’s manager, and secured them gigs in his club, also named Middle Earth. “The Rockfield Session” where recorded in 1973 with a new guitarist/singer and saxophone player. Jimmy Hush, the original WOTW drummer, located a few years ago the master tapes and mixed them for the first time. So here we have a complete unreleased studio album. Great, great music of cause!
