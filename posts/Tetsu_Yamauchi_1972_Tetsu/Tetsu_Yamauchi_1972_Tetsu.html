   Tetsu Yamauchi started his musical career in Japan, and became internationally recognized when he replaced Andy Fraser in Free. He recorded the solid Kossoff / Kirke / Tetsu / Rabbit side-project before doing Free’s final album, the aptly-named Heartbreaker.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When Ronnie Lane left the Faces in 1973, Free had just split for the last time. The first person considered as a replacement for Lane was Andy Fraser. When the boys approached Simon Kirke, Free’s drummer, about contacting Fraser with the offer, Simon recommended Tetsu, instead.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After the Faces ground to a halt, Yamauchi returned to Japan. He is, to this day, a fixture in the Japanese music scene, actively touring and recording.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tetsu was born October 21, 1946, in Fukuoka, Japan. By the mid Sixties, Tetsu was in the Japanese folk-rock band, the Mikes. In late 1967 or early 1968, he joined a band that was touring Europe called Samurai. They moved to London for a time, recording the single “Good Morning Starshine” b/w “Temple of Gold” (UA UP2342), and a single released in Italy, “Shu Shu” b/w “Fresh Hot Breeze of Summer”. They released an album on the German label, Metronome, and possibly an album in 1969 (Phillips FX-8511). As an aside, it appears as though it’s the same Graham Smith that has worked with Teresa Brewer, Cat Stevens, Al Stewart, Magna Carta, and Alan Price, among others.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   By 1970, Samurai returned to Japan. The band was led by it’s vocalist, Miki Curtis. Tetsu also got a lot of session work through Miki, who was a successful producer. This included work with jazz vocalist Helen Merrill’s son, Alan.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1972, Tetsu released the first of two solo albums. Information so far is sketchy (particularly on the second album).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Good folk-rock, not a lot of organ, sometimes acoustic instruments only. The feeling of the music derives from the beat-era. Sounds like a mix of Donovan and Procol Harum. Sung in English.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The good one blues rock album by the former leader of Japanese progressive group Samurai recorded in fall 1972. There was an experience previously with musicians from Free (album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit was released in 1971) and it is so noticeable: the opening "Wiki Wiki" is similar to alittle bit funky Free, and "Why" - so typical Free track in their classic style. There is soul influence in some tracks but not too much. Among album's ten tracks - three instrumental, most successfull from them is "First Time" with the lead electic organ stylistically between Atomic Rooster and Booker T. &amp; MG's. Yamauchi gathered pretty strong cast, that included two drummers - Yuji Harada, who played with Tetsu in Samurai, and an omnipresent Hiro Tsunoda. A part of musicians in 1973 took part in the project Friends, in particular, ex-vocalist and harper of The Beavers Ken Narita, The Spiders former keyboardist Katsuo Ohno and guitarist Pipi Sabata. It should be mentioned that vocal parts were given to the three singers, and except Yamauchi himself and Ken Narita, there is an American Eleonore Barooshian (member of female psychedelic trio The Cake, aka Chelsea Lee). It should be recognized that not the all compositions are the same successfull but totally this album is pretty nice...

   Tetsu Yamauchi “Tetsu”  Released in October 1972, this is the 2nd pressing of 1976, ultra rare solo effort of Free bass player Yamauchi Tetsuo (later down the line he would join the Faces). Yamauchi went for the first time on an European tour as one of Miki’s Curtis and Samurai’s band members. Upon touching down in the UK, he hooked up with Free and became their bass player. He got quite a reputation as Free’s bass throbbing magician and upon his brief return to Japan in 1971 he dove into the recording studio in order to put down his solo effort. He flanked himself with female singer Eleanor, Hiro Tsunoda (of Jacks fame) and some other compatriots. The opening track that kick starts this record is an instant psyched-out rock classic, sounding more European than Oriental in nature. Probably his teaming up with Free and the faces might have some hand in that but those these ears it is exactly this Nipponized European feel that does the trick here, making this disc a solid gem. The whole of the disc breathes out a solid UK rockin’ feel, interlarded with psychedelic touches, instrumental breakdowns and even a funky solid as rock number also appear here. In short, this utterly Japanese band kicks major ass and would have been bigger than life if they had recorded this treasure of a disc in the UK with a proper European release. A lost masterpiece...
