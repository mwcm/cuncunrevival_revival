   This is a terrific double album and offers plenty for diehard fans who may think they have everything. It would also serve as a very useful introduction to Motorheads live sound for people who've only heard Ace of Spades. The BBC radio sessions are superbly engineered, with some restraint on the full on deafening sound of a live gig for an audience, the BBC sound guys no doubt seeking to minimize distortion for their listeners at home. It works and whilst holding nothing back you get to hear the musicianship of a tight band, particularly the seminal 3 piece line up of the 78 &amp; 81 sessions. The live theatre show from 79 is a different matter, however, Lemmy getting free reign to deafening the public! It's great to hear the band on top form and so clearly enjoying their new found "stardom", Lemmys asides and banter with the fans illustrating the guy's intelligence and humour. The final radio session from 86 is of course the 4 man set up and includes much fine playing and spirited renditions of Orgasmatron, Doctor Rock &amp; particularly Deaf Forever. Sadly the boys have gone to where the pool tables &amp; free JD are, but we have the music for ever.
