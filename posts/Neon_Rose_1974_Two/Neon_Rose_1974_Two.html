   This is a good, solid, heavy metal style hard rock album; of that there should be little argument. However, I found their sound too substantially biased in the commercial direction. Fans of underground progressive hard rock might not find what they are looking for here. The album is rather typical of its time, though it could be debated it was a couple of years early, as this type of record didn't really proliferate until the later 70's. The guitar playing is stellar, though the material used to showcase it isn't always as outstanding. Indeed, I found a few of these tracks particularly undistinguished, even though I enjoy this type of rock. But then again, it certainly has its standouts, of which the epic "Bloody Wellfare" is probably my pick. It was recorded in Sept, 1974 in Stockholm, and the original issue came with a lyric sleeve.
