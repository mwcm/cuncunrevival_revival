  While this album will forever be remembered for spawning the huge hit singles "Frankenstein" and "Free Ride," there's plenty more to appreciate on this stellar release. From "the other single,""Hangin' Around," to the pretty melodies of "Round &amp; Around" and "Autumn," the set collects ten outstanding cuts, played with fervor by Edgar Winter, Chuck Ruff, Dan Hartman, Randy Jo Hobbs, and Ronnie Montrose, along with guest artist/producer Rick Derringer. The "party" feel of "We All Had a Real Good Time" and the singalong "Alta Mira" only add to this already red-hot mix, making They Only Come Out at Night the album Winter will always be remembered for.

  Edgar Winter throws it all against the wall on They Only Come Out at Night... and it sticks. Like the work of a mad scientist in the laboratory, E.W. slaved in the studio with a variety of styles, that resulted in a hot collection of rockers, blues, funk, pop, a ballad, and an intense instrumental that turned into a monster. TOCOAN features ten tracks, highlighted by the summertime driving classic, "Free Ride", plus the album's longest number, the electrified instrumental "Frankenstein", the lovely "Autumn", the up-tempo album opener, "Hangin' Around", and the ballsy "Undercover Man". With Ronnie Montrose on board, laying out the killer guitar work, along with vocals from Dan Hartman, and Chuck Huff pounding the kit, the Edgar Winter Group scored big time throughout They Only Come Out at Night. Mighty-mite rocker, Rick "All-American Boy" Derringer, assisted on this classic recording from 1972.
