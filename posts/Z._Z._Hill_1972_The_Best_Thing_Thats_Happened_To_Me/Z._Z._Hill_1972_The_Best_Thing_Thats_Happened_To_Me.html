   Under the guidance of his brother Matt, with whom he had just recorded the Top 20 R&amp;B hit "Don’t Make Me Pay For His Mistakes" on Matt's independent Hill label, Z.Z. next struck a deal with United Artists in 1972.

   His first album for that company, along with the two that would follow, clearly demonstrate Hill shifting toward a more funky terrain, a musical venture that suited the singer very well. 'The Best Thing That’s Happened To Me' is a very strong album brimming with mid-tempo grooves, all wonderfully produced by brother Matt and West Coast recording alumnus Arthur Wright.

   The overall mood of the LP is set instantly with Jimmy Lewis' pensive "I’ve Got To Get You Back", a smouldering piece of gutbucket, swampy Southern Soul featuring Hill's groaning and pleading lead. While not as busy as the rendition of Bobby Womack on his seminal 1972 album 'Understanding', the lazy groove, augmented by subdued backing vocals and a hint of brass, is a perfect vehicle for Hill's downhome, Texas drawl vocal delivery. Another track culled from Lewis' songbook, "Friendship Only Goes So Far", is more of a soulful country effort.

   Next up is an updated, frantic funk workout of Hill's very first hit, the self-written "You Were Wrong". A sharp horn arrangement and the plodding beat set it miles apart from its '60s predecessor. That same year, blues guitarist and fellow Texan Freddie King would cut an equally swiniging version of the song, retitled "You Was Wrong", for his LP 'Texas Cannonball'.

   Chicago Soul singer/guitarist Fred Hughes – who recorded some of the last successful sides for the fabled Vee Jay label in 1965 – wrote no less than four tracks for Hill's premier UA album, and in a way, is the unsung hero of this LP. The fatback groove monster "Your Love Makes Me Feel Good" has Hill soaring over a wild rythmic stew propelled by a sizzling bass, congas and razor sharp 'chanks' on guitar. "Your Love", arguably the best track here, is another incredibly strong, driving tour de force. Whereas Hill's voice remains subdued in the opening stanzas, he rips it up on the chorus, where a simple but oh so effective horn arrangement keeps the infectious beat rolling on. "Cause I Love You" is almost a carbon copy of "Your Love", although steeped more firmly in the Blues. "Dream Don't Let Me Down", on the other hand, is a slow burner. A beautiful, contemplative piece perfectly suited for Hill's desperate pleadings, riding on top of a slow, almost stuttering, mesmerizing groove.

   Hill's choice of material to cover is tasteful, as well. There is a lurching, almost weeping rendition of  "My Adorable One", a song previously recorded by soul giants Joe Simon and Percy Sledge. "Can I Get A Witness", originally popularized by Motown heavy Marvin Gaye in 1963, is upgraded, and a heavily retooled, funked up reading of "The Red Rooster" takes this ageless Willie Dixon classic into the '70s. In between, Hill tries his hand at "Love In The Street", a soulful, bluesy composition by Stax producer Don Davis (nom de guerre: Arthur Snyder), that was first recorded as the B-side to Johnnie Taylor’s 1971 hit "Hijackin' Love".  Hill's first chart hit for UA, however, consisted of a torrid, incredibly raw version of Bobby 'Blue' Bland's "Ain't Nothing You Can Do", which has Z.Z. almost blaring through the speakers.
