   Formed in Neath, Wales, Eyes of Blue initial line up consisted of guitarist Ritchie Francis, singer Gary Pickford-Hopkins, keyboardist Phil Ryan, drummer Wyndham Rees, and bassist Ray Williams.  The quintet apparently started out as a soul-oriented cover band, eventually attracting the attention of Decca’s progressive-oriented DERAM label, which signed them to a recording contract and releasing a pair of hard-to-find singles:

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   - 1966’s ‘Heart Trouble’ b/w ‘Up and Down’ (DERAM catalog number DM 106)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   - 1967’s ‘Supermarket Full of Cans’ b/w ‘Don’t Ask Me’ (DERAM catalog number DRM 114).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band’s big break came when Mercury’s London based A&amp;R man Lou Reizner played one of the group’s tapes for American producer Quincy Jones.  Jones was in London starting work on a score for the film “The Toy Grabbers” (renamed “Mother” when released in the States).  Deciding he needed a more contemporary sound for the movie, he subsequently recruited the band to help score the film.  The resulting publicity led Mercury to sign them, resulting in the release of 1968’s “The Crossroads of Time”.

   Following another movie project; they scored music for “Connecting Rooms” and even had a brief role in the film, they returned to the studio for the second album.

   Following a series of personnel changes that saw Rees and Williams replaced by drummer John Weathers and bassist Ray Bennett, the band released 1969’s “In Fields of Ardath”.  Produced by Reizner (Quincy Jones furnished the liner notes), the album was apparently meant as a concept piece, the title track and several of the songs built around the theme of reincarnation.  To quote the liner notes:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “The title of the album stems from the interest of Eyes of Blue in the supernatural and the occult.  Ardath is the title of a book by Marie Corelli published in 1897.  The theme of the novel is based on the story of reincarnation.  According to the book the field of Ardath is located near the ruined city of Babylon. Corelli’s characters find evidence for this presumed location in the Book of Esdras.”

   Featuring a mixture of covers and original material, material like ‘Ardath’ and ‘Door (The Child That Is Born On the Sabbath Day)’ found the band exploring a more progressive and keyboard dominated sound.  Not particularly focused, this time around they attempted to broaden their horizons adding a host of influences including country-rock (‘Chances’), English blues (‘After the War’), pop (‘Little Bird’), and even a scratchy tribute to jazz guitarist Django Renhard (‘Souvenirs (Tribute To Django)’).  As lead vocalist Pickford-Hopkins raspy voice remained an acquired taste, though to be perfectly honest, he was frequently all but drown out by the elaborate arrangements.  While nowhere near as much fun as the debut, the collection wasn’t a complete wash out.  Perhaps not a big surprise, they were at their best when sticking with more mainstream rock oriented material – in this case ‘The Light We See’ (featuring a killer backward guitar solo), their cover of Graham Bond’s ‘Spanish Blues’, and the closing instrumental ‘Apache ‘69’ (with some nice Francis lead guitar) serving as the LP highlights.  Elsewhere the leadoff track ‘Merry Go Round’ was lifted from their earlier “Toy-Grabbers” soundtrack.  Pleasant but hardly a forgotten classic. ..

   Wyndham Rees was eased out of the Eyes Of Blue before the spring of 1969, having reputedly contributed little to the band. He was present during most of the Chappell Studios early recording sessions for the group's second album 'In Fields Of Ardath' but was gone by the time they gravitated to more modern eight-track facilities. It was released in November and is generally regarded as the more successful and 'progressive' of the two albums released under the Eyes Of Blue name. Quincy Jones supplied the sleevenotes this time, and commented; "All the ethnic qualities which I had recalled about the people of Wales were manifest in that tape. There was a native sensuality in their playing. Eyes Of Blue was musically curious." The record has also been described as having "Pop, R&amp;B jazz, classical, psychedelic and Eastern influences." A fair sprinkling one must admit.
