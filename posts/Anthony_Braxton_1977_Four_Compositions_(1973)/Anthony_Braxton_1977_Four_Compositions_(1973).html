   As much as it might sound like science fiction, there was a time when the Anthony Braxton section of the record pile was as thin as a half-eaten pop tart package. Now that the Braxton section threatens to topple the wings of apartment buildings occupied by record collectors, the value of this session might seem questionable, but when first made available as a Japanese import, these performances were highly valued, filling in a few important rows in this artist's often mysterious crossword puzzle. It features a session taped with Japanese players in one day in which four Braxton compositions are performed. The fact that Braxton had been invited to Japan and had made a superior-quality recording of his own pieces with three good musicians was considered quite important, and it was even assumed by some that the hip Japanese players might have had more success with Braxton's music than some of the squares who were floundering around with it back home and in Europe. A voluminous discography has removed much of the mystery that might have accompanied a listener's early exposure to these performances, in which the skilled and quite creative Japanese musicians confront the dynamic of Braxton. There is a sense of scrambling to some of the forward motion; one imagines Braxton leading the others down a trail that keeps getting steeper and steeper. "Composition No. 1," dedicated to Richard Teitelbaum, begins the album in a much different way, focusing on silence and so-called threshold sounds in a manner that was quite revolutionary for any music connected with jazz, a genre in which the quietest thing was the bass solo, and it was assumed that would be drowned out by rattling ice cubes and chit-chat. Speaking of jazz, the piece dedicated to Warne Marsh really features some lovely alto playing from the boss. As decades pass, documents such as this are audible pages out of the Braxton diary, memorable moments out of a lifetime of superb musical achievement. The pieces are identified as numbered compositions, but Braxton's actual title pictures are reproduced on the album jacket.
