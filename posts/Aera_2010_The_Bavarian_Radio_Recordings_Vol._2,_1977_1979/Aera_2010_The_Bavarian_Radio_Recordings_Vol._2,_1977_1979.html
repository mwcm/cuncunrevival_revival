  Volume 2 of the Bavarian broadcast series present further recordings of Area, for once from the period 1977-1979. Five live tracks from 2 concerts and four tracks recorded in Bavarian Broadcast Corporation owned studio 'Franken''at Nuremberg'. Aera played a lively jazz-rock dominated by soloist and sax and flute player Klaus Kreuzeder, based on powerful and clever keyboard playing all held together by amazing bass player Matz Steinke and drummer Lutz Oldemeier (of Missus Beastly-fame) and lots of percussions. Aera were in a very good shape and gave their best. Highlights are the 17 minutes long version of 'Dracula´s Frühstück' and nearly 10 minutes version of 'You need some speed'. All titles were digitally remastered from the original tapes. Booklets contains the history of the recordings and rare photos. Highly recommended!
