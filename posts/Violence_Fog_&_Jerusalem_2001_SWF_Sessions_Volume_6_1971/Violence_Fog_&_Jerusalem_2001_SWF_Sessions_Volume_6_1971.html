   Whereas previous CDs released in the SWF-Sessions series were devoted to one band, Vol. 6 in the series features VIOLENCE FOG and JERUSALEM. Both bands have their roots in the south-western part of Germany where they enjoyed local fame.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It would, however, be wrong to accuse VIOLENCE FOG and JERUSALEM of being provincial or average. The titles recorded for the former radio station SWF demonstrate both musical originality and considerable technical ability.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Compared to previous releases in the SWF-Sessions series, VIOLENCE FOG and JERUSALEM really belong to the ‘guitar‘ category, in VIOLENCE FOG’s case, with the noticeable addition use of flute and some impressive singing, while JERUSALEM are characterized by epic music pieces with West Coast overtones.

   VIOLENCE FOG was formed in 1969 from members of various local bands in the Baden-Baden region (of Germany). It only took a few rehearsals before they were making successful live appearances where, apart from original compositions, their repertoire also included their own version of ‘Brother Where Are You‘ (Remo Four) and ‘Paint It Black‘ (R. Stones). The band had a considerable fan following who accompanied them to their shows in the German south-west. In addition to playing gigs in youth centres and music clubs, VIOLENCE FOG also played at local film premieres and performances of music films like Easy Rider, Woodstock, Alice’s Restaurant and Let It Be. The band scored a great hit with their elaborate psychedelic light show projected onto the cinema screen.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   By the mid-seventies the group had achieved more than just local fame and decided to try their luck with SWF which was producing a series for potentially successful up-and-coming groups. On 23.4.71 the band achieved their aim and recorded the titles released on this CD in the radio station’s own studio U1 in Baden-Baden.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite the motivation created by the SWF recordings the band broke up a few weeks later for professional reasons. Intensive research has failed to shed light on any other publishable title by the band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Guitarist Enno Dernov and drummer Herbert Brandmeier later played together in Jud’s Gallery (SWF-Sessions Vol. 1), Enno Dernov leaving the group several month before the recordings were made at SWF. He went on to join Brainstorm and took over as bass player on their second LP before joining Respect. The twin brothers Karl-Heinz and Wolfgang Höfer changed over to playing folk music.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   JERUSALEM was formed at the end of 1969 when Matthias Stein and Richard Reß quit the goup Intoxication and after Hungry Love with Günther Rüffel, Wolfgang Hilgert and Bernd Lewandowski split up. The five 16-20 year-old school kids and job trainees were already a permanent feature of the music scene in and around Landau in the Palatinate region of Germany and wanted to create their own sound, having become fed up with playing other people’s international hits. The highly motivated young musicians had soon put together a stage show featuring all their own compositions and were soon the number one attraction on the Landau music scene. There were two reasons for the group’s popularity: the impressive interaction of the two lead guitars (Matthias Stein and Günther Rüffel) and the fact that JERUSALEM used two bass players (Richard Reß and Wolfgang Hilgert).

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The band’s music, following as it did the progressive trends of the time, was an expression of the creative potential of each band member and enthusiastically received by the fans. As a result of various appearances at the same gigs, JERUSALEM got noticed by other better-known bands like Ihre Kinder and Frumpy and were asked to play as warm-up group. A tour with Frumpy saw JERUSALEM playing not only in the south-west and south of Germany but also in Austria and Switzerland. JERUSALEM appeared on the same show as Fashion Pink (SWF-Sessions Vol. 3), Roland Schaeffer’s band. SWF had given Roland Schaeffer the job of organizing the talent contest for up-and-coming new bands. JERUSALEM were one of the applicants for the contest and on 04.06.1971 recorded the titles on this CD in the radio station’s own studio. All the songs were broadcast in the SWF 3 programme ‘Pop-Shop‘. However, the band were never able to take advantage of their resulting increased popularity.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A few month after the SWF recordings singer and guitarist Matthias Stein died in a tragic motor cycle accident. Richard Reß, Matthias Stein’s friend of many years was so badly shaken that he gave up his musical career and withdrew from public life. These events marked the end of JERUSALEM. Intensive research has likewise failed to turn up any additional titles by this innovative band. The remaining musicians joined other local groups. Günther Rüffel plays for a cover band in his spare time. Bernd Lewandowski works as a free-lance musician.

   VIOLENCE FOG and JERUSALEM are striking examples how Kraut and Progressive Rock was not only reserved for the big metropolises but was also a regional phenomenon.

   VIOLENCE FOG is a Krautrock German band from Baden-Baden formed in 1969. The band members on the duel project featuring JERUSALEM include Hilmar Beine on bass, Herbert Brandmeyer on drums, Enno Dernov on guitar, Karl-Heinz Höfer on guitar, flute, vocals, and Wolfgang Höfer on vocals, and flute. Influences of the band include THE ROLLING STONES hard blues era in the same vein as the classic 'Paint it Black'. In their early years VIOLENCE FOG performed the Stones classic and a version of 'Brother Where Are You' by Remo Four. They performed in the German south-west region, playing youth centres and small gigs at music clubs attracting a following. The band made appearances playing at local film premieres such as 60s milestone movies "Easy Rider", "Woodstock", and "Let It Be". At the premiers there was often a psychedelic light show that was projected onto the cinema screen.

   In April 1971 SWF radio sessions picked up the band and recorded music that became their first album. The band broke up weeks later and members joined other bands such as JUD'S GALLERY, BRAINSTORM and RESPECT.

   VIOLENCE FOG released one studio album in 1971 "Violence Fog/ Jerusalem" so titled as it was the reunion of two albums from two artists, taken from the radio SWF sessions featuring both VIOLENCE FOG and JERUSALEM. These two bands are Krautrock in its heavier phase alongside of other heavy rock artists ZARATHUSTRA, PANCAKE, SPERMULL, and IRMIN'S WAY. The VIOLENCE FOG tracks feature heavy guitars, and very melodic singing. JERUSALEM are featured on the last 3 tracks, which are proggy and lengthy at times, with strong lead guitar breaks and frenetic riffing. There are psychedelic flourishes and some complex structures throughout. This is an album recommended for the Krautrock fanbase.
