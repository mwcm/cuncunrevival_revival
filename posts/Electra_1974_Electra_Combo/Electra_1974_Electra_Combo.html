   German band ELECTRA was formed in 1969 by 5 students from the Dresden School of Music in what was then the eastern part of the divided Germany. They made a name for themselves by reinterpretating classical symphonic music using contemporary, electronic instruments as well as producing original compositions of elongated, progressive rock with a firm emphasis on elongated instrumental solos. They made their debut as Electra-Combo in 1974 with the album Electra Combo.

   From 1975 and onwards they decided to stick with the shorter Electra band name. A string of critically acclaimed productions followed in the next few years, but in the 1980's the creative spirits of the band appeared to dwindle. Possibly due to the not too friendly politicial climate that developed in Eastern Germany in the final years before the iron curtain became history, perhaps due to line-up alterations or a general change of direction for the band.

   But following the fall of the iron curtain, Germany reuniting as one nation and old members returning to the band they rediscovered their creative and artistic roots again. So far not documented on a studio album however, as their latest studio effort was recorded as far back as 1989 in the shape of Der Aufrechte Gang (although not released until 2004). But Electra has continued being a presence on stage over the years and are still a popular and active live unit as of 2012.

   One of the long-lived acts from East Germany, Electra came from Dresden and were found in 1969 by wind instrumentalist Bernd Aust, bassist Wolfgang Riedel, guitarist Ekkehard Berger, drummer/singer Peter Ludewig and keyboardist Karl-Heinz Ringel.The band had a good live activity and by the time of their first album Ringel and Berger were replaced by singer Stephan Trepte, Hans Peter Dohanetz on keys and Peter Sandkaulen on guitars.As with many East German bands their debut ''Electra-Combo'' (1974) was released on Amiga.

   Reputedly Electra had a very daring progressive sound, but the social conservation of DDR prevent the band of recording a trully adventurous album, while they even supported pop artists around the same time.So their debut was actually an incoherent mix of different styles with plenty of rough vocals, a raw guitar sound, somewhat dated organ work and a fair amount of flutes.Their style is quite close to that of JETHRO TULL's, filled with flute drives and solos, deeped in Blues and Heavy Rock aesthetics but in a rather commercial vein with simple song structures, only interrupted by some nice guitar, organ and flute solos.The grooves though are a bit interesting with the band breathing a hell of energy, guitars are really dominant supported by jazzy organs and a pounding rhythm section, while the talent of the members is evident, even in this commercial outfit.However the lack of trully adventurous musicianship, the somewhat dull vocals, the sometimes laughable lyrics (for those who understand German) and a couple of weak straight Blues tracks prevent the album of being an essential effort.

   Classic commercial Deutsch Rock with a few interesting instrumental moments in each track, not a great album by any means but definitely a historical document of the age.
