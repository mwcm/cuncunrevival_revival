  This album was supposed to be released in 1977 but because of a dispute between Sancious' old label Epic and his new one Arista over ownership rights, it wasn't released until 2004 ! This album continues pretty much in the same path as the previous one but we do get vocals on a couple of tracks. Those two vocal tracks if anything lower my opinion of it.
  <br/>
  "Overture" features vocals that come in quickly including some cringe worthy backing vocals.This is really wimpy except for the bass. "1st Movement" opens with vocal melodies followed by drums and organ a minute in. A calm with vocal melodies return then it kicks in once more before we get a steady rhythm with lots of keyboards 3 1/2 minutes in. The tempo shifts often after 6 1/2 minutes. The best part of the song is 11 minutes in.

  "2nd Movement" opens with atmosphere before an orchestral-like soundscape takes over. A calm follows then it kicks back in quickly. Best parts are after 2 and 4 minutes. "The Dawn" is laid back with a beat and keyboards leading the way. "3rd Movement" opens with a flury of keyboards and drums then it settles as contrasts continue. "4th Movement" is led by piano throughout. "Finale Part I" has a Middle Eastern vibe with vocals. "Finale Part II" is my favourite tune as it's filled with atmosphere only.
