   Brazilian vocalist Flora Purim became famous after her participation on one of the best ever recorded fusion albums - Chick Corea's Return To Forever. After one more release with Corea she left for concentrating more on solo career.

   Flora's album, from very early and till some recorded in 90s, all contain music which is more or less related with Latin/fusion atmosphere of first RTF works. "open Your Eyes..."contains three RTF/Corea's covers plus five Flora's or/and Hermeto Pascoal originals, recorded in similar key.

   Comparing with previous Purim solo albums' music, one can find more energetic, more rhythmic and more accessible songs here. Rooted deeply in her trademark Latin/fusion mixture, this album's music is obviously more oriented on possible commercial success. As a result, it looses in part dreamy spiritual atmosphere which was so significant success' component of Flora's earlier works, but from other hand whole music is lighter and more optimistic.

   As an original member of Chick Corea's group Return to Forever, Purim subsequently drew praise as a solo act. Recording for the jazz label Milestone since 1973, Purim's sensual and strong voice was singular enough to withstand the pitfalls that hampered the work of many Latin jazz fusion artists. Open Your Eyes You Can Fly represents a commercial breakthrough, and has the artist again supplemented by adventurous players and top-notch songwriting. The best of the three Chick Corea tracks is the title song. With it's emotive and stinging guitar solo from David Amaro, it features Purim at her most accessible and charming. The remake of "Sometime Ago" has one of Corea's more accessible melodies, as Purim turns in one of her more sweet and fulfilling vocals. The melodic and soothing "San Francisco River" has the artist writing solely with frequent Corea collaborator Neville Potter on the evocative track. Despite the great work here, Open Your Eyes You Can Fly, lacks consistency. But with the great talents assembled and great voice, it's easy to overlook that fact. Hermeto Pascoal's "Andei (I Walked)" has a great synthesizer solo from George Duke and a flute solo from Pascoal. "Ina's Song (Trip to Bahia)" features Purim singing in Portuguese, starting off slow but then enlivened by her passion filled vocalizations. Produced by jazz producer Orrin Keepnews, this features the artist more lucid and joyful than some of her other work. For the reason it is recommended.
