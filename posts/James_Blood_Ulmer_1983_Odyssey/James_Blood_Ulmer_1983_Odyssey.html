  This record moves towards and has all the best elements of Jazz that are so close to Prog, as to become invisible borders. For newcomers JBU sounds like JBU. No latin or world jazz fusions, closer to old traditional blues standards, his language in composition makes no compromises to this school not another.
  <br/>
  His approach is completely free of cliches, in fact it is quiet wild, BUT, not funky at all. Intelligent songs performed tightlly by an interesting bass-less trio. Violin, drums and the virtuous JBU's electric guitars and mysticaly subversive vocals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This effort is completely prog do not mistake its intentions. In fact, if the" Post/Jazz-Rock" tagging was available, ODYSSEY will fit in perfectly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So as mentioned do not expect, Mahavishnu, Chick Corea, O. Coleman or even Miles kind of prog/jazz . Odyssey stands alone, closer if need to compare to, with Hendrix personal song writing, without the funk (and bass player), but with all the prog-fury and gentleness required. The comparisson comes in quiet handy considering JBU's guitar playing skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Highly recommendable for any prog audiophile, it trascends its own roots to become a any prog follower great aquisition.
