  Way back in 1977, die-hard Aerosmith fans waited and waited for the follow-up to the raging Rocks album to finally drop. We filled the down-time crankin' the latest releases from other American rockers, such as ol' Uncle Ted (Cat Scratch Fever), Starz (Violation), Derringer (Sweet Evil and Derringer Live), Cheap Trick (Cheap Trick and In Color), Lynyrd Skynyrd (Street Survivors), Ram Jam (Ram Jam) and the legendary Blue Öyster Cult (Spectres). In additon, the boys from Brownsville Station filled the Aero void when the group pushed out their self titled LP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Issued in May of '77, the Brownsville Station album was promoted with the slogan "Comin' right at ya!". Billed as their most powerful album to date, the quartet of guitarist Michael "Cub" Koda, bassist Michael Lutz, primal drummer Henry "H-Bomb" Weck and newest member Bruce Nazarian, locked-in and banged-out a fun collection of cuts. The ten song album rolls from the off with the heated action of "Hot Spit", which is chased by the raunch of "Sleazy Louise", and lead single "Lady (Put the Light on Me)".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brownsville Station lay on three-minutes of Motor City action with "Rockers 'n' Rollers", while trippin'-in with a shot of power pop via a short cover of "Ain't That a Shame". Produced by Eddie Kramer, Brownsville Station closes in a major way with the lengthy and comical "The Martian Boogie". For those that were around at the time of it's release, you can relate to the lyrical reference from "The Martian Boogie" that notes the old, all-night dives that simply went by the name of "EAT". spelled out in loud neon lights. That don't make 'em like "EAT" anymore... and bands like Brownsville Station are long gone as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brownsville Station took to the road during the hot summer of '77 in support of their latest recording. Hitting the Midwest hard, the boys supported Aerosmith for a few shows in the rustbelt in early Autumn, despite the fact that the Boston bad boys were still pulling together tracks for the eventual release of Draw the Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I caught Brownsville Station and Aerosmith together on October 5th of 1977 at The Mecca (aka The Arena) in Milwaukee. Never ones to take themselves seriously, Brownsville Station chugged their way through a fun set, while Tyler's gang hit the backstage drug buffet in a major way, before blowing through an abbreviated set in order to party late into the night. The show is just another distant rock 'n' roll memory from the crazed daze and wild nights when a concert was less than ten bones, and you could get away with smokin' in the boys room.
