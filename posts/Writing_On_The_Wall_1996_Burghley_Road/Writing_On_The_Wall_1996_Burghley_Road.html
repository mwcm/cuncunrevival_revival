  The album title refers to the Victorian house where four Scots took refuge during his exile in London becoming the mansion into a genuine commune dedicated to music, art and God knows what else in the early 70s. A pleasant surprise, it is true that there were thousands of bands like this at the time but Writing on the Wall is at hand now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides his official album, "Power of the Picts", the seal was circulated Tenth Planet, love of another similar product, the album that here and now we claim. WRITING ON THE WALL ''Burghley Road'' LP (UK, Tenth Planet, Catalogue #TP018) Brand new/unplayed copy of limited Tenth Planet label LP edition (edition of 1000 copies only) of previously unreleased 1972 recordings of Scottish hard/heavy rock band Writing On The Wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously unreleased 1972 sessions for their aborted second album, Burghley Road captures the legendary Scottish hard rockers in full flight as they combine Deep Purple-style heavy rock aggression with a more introspective approach reminiscent of the Band. Had this unique album been issued at the time it may well have catapulted Writing on the Wall into the big time, but legal problems prevented its release. Full-colour sleeve with song-notes by bassist and chief songwriter Jake Scott, Burghley Road is a vinyl-only release of 1000 numbered copies.

  <br/>
  "Writing On The Wall present themselves here as a typical Pub Rock band who mix Prog Rock/Blues Rock with elements handed down via tradition. It's no coincidence that guitarist Willie Finlayson later cropped up in Bees Make Honey, bringing with him the title tune of this album.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing On The Wall , however, pull it off best when they head for a more sophisticated and psychedelic approach, with the organ and guitar given room to expand as on "Dream Yourself A Hero or "Live And Learn' (which could have stemmed from Jody Grind's debut). Using their basement to rehearse, the band capture their own performance of new songs on a reel-to-reel tape recorder in an effort to review their progress. These basement tapes capture the band's rampant musical schizophrenia as they move effortlessly from anthemic heavy rock onslaughts to Band-style rural introspection.' LP, we may think that blues and hard rock primary began to play a greater role in the band's sound as his career progressed, "Diane's Big Daddy," as if the echoes of the debut of BLACK SABBATH, the beginning of "Live and Learn"can compare to "Child In Time" DEEP PURPLE, "Henry Dawson', sailing a middle course between Rory Gallagher and Colosseum."
