   And then they were three. Manfred Wieczorke has now left the band and Klaus Hess is holding the keys on top of his guitar work. It is definitely a loss even if Manfred did not stay long with "Jane".

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The opener is still a good hard-rocking piece of music and "That's The Way" returns to their psychedelic themes of their debut and therefore sounds outdated in this 1979 release. It fully sounds as the very early "Floyd". A bit harder in the second part with a great guitar and heavy keys. It is my fave on this album. A highlight, frankly.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Bizarrely, "Love Can't Wait" sounds as a song from the great "Lou Reed". Same type of vocals (really very close), heavy riff and strong guitar again (but Hess has been used us to this). A bit to much extended probably but quite decent.

   The time is not on the epic side any longer. Only one track over six minutes (the opener and title track). One of the shortest is "Henry Goes Married". It started as an uninspired instrumental and mellow piece of music but turned into a better category when the Floydian guitar enters the scene. Not great, but not bad by any means.

   The first weak track is "Say Hello". Vocals are pretty bad and the whole track falls pretty deep. Even Hess's guitar work won't save it. The type of "press next" song, if you see what I mean.

   I like pretty much "Moonstone". A harder version of "A Writer Shade Of Pale" in its initial phase (with the guitar replacing the organ). This song is frankly excellent even if the production is not top notch to say the least. I am just found of these guitar sounds. Another very good song. Fantastic riff, really and a must listen for each guitar fan.

   "Love On Earth" is not a great song, that's for sure. Vocals are pretty weird. It's the second low point of this album because the next "Letter To Mariann" is on a better edge. Again, a fantastic guitar play. This characteristic truely holds this album in a good territory. And even if the closing song has nothing to do with a highlight, the guitar and the instrumental parts are very good.

   I don't find this album so weak after all. Far much better than "Jane III" (their weakest so far IMO).
