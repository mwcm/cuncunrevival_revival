  It is David Sancious of "Musician in the musician" and the praised keyboard player in Peter Gabriel. And, the technology and knowledge that masters not only the keyboard but also very various musical instruments might be the points that should be exactly praised.
  <br/>
  The activity of David Sancious after it had resigned from E.Street Band that led Bruce Springsteen in 1974 might always have offered the listener the work with high quality in which all Music's genres were exactly covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is necessary to evaluate the talent of David Sancious known by competing with musicians such as Stanley Clarke, Peter Gabriel, and Sting high. It is likely to be able to listen to the work at time when the talent, the sense, and the idea were blocked most remarkably in his work in the 70's.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Sancious forms "Tone" of own band in 1974. A recent work was time of the creation where his very a variety of element and idea were blocked. David Sancious is indeed well versed for Progressive Rock. Making those element and sound is expressed by the album of the "Tone" name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Sancious And Tone dissolves by "True Stories" announced in 1978. However, the desire of the created music enchanted the listener with the revolution in the flow that he announced the album by the name of Solo. The part where Eddy Offord had been appointed as a producer as well as "True Stories" of the former work concretely showed the music that David Sancious exactly created. The flow that the element of Jazz/Fusion and Prog Rock is taken to completion S well taking the sound of symphonic might be a result of bringing forth of the work of Eddy Offord and the creation of David Sancious splendidly. It is refined further, and all good parts might be developed and the creativity cultivated in the work of "Tone" been extracted. And, it is a work that should be able to be called the sound Jazz Rock/Prog Rock completely refined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Run" starts in the line of Bass that David Sancious plays. And, the original sound that David Sancious plays twines round the melody of the guitar with a complete sense. The rhythm of Ernest Carter keeps fast Passage and supports the tune. David Sancious plays the guitar well. The sound and has finished ..Jazz-Rock that the quality in which "Bruford" and Allan Holdsworth in the 70's are reminiscent is high... Progressing the tune not to forecast by making good use of fast and slow has a completely progressive flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just As I Thought" becomes complete piano and the rhythm that intermittently repeats the rhythm of the odd number and advances. The idea of David Sancious accompanies a good fusion of Jazz/Fusion and Prog Rock attended with an original sound. The composition and the flow of piano Chord are also preeminent. A variegated sound makes one space. There are only 30 second of one minute tune. However, creativity is exactly proportional to the album. And, Jeff Berlin takes charge of Bass in this tune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Again" might be a tune that gives width as the entire impression of this album. How the creation of David Sancious is not biased to one genre might be understood. Making the keyboard and a piano melody and the sound is splendid though the tune advances around the song. The gentle ballade sung by Kabir Ghani might have had a moving flow. Solo of the keyboard performs moving solo while using a progressive sound. It is a tune with which the part where David Sancious is good is exactly blocked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for "The Naked I", the arpeggio of a beautiful, acoustic guitar by Davis Sancious is impressive. The obbligati of the keyboard with the anacatesthesia twines well, too. The part where the tune that fast and slow is put as a composition of the album and the fraction is short is arranged might succeed as one of the senses, too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Valley Of The Shadow" is a tune that the element of Prog Rock unites completely in Jazz/Fusion. The tune explodes because of the sound of the keyboard with Spacey's element. A powerful rhythm twines round a beautiful piano melody. The tune reaches the peak at once and shifts to solo of the keyboard. The combination of the sounds of the keyboard is indeed variegated. And, the excitement continues. It returns to the theme again and the guitar twines. This flow will be reminiscent of the element of Bruford in the 70's, too. The part of the negotiation with the keyboard and the guitar might be exactly a highlight of the tune with the tension continued. The technology of David Sancious that surely expresses these ideas is splendid. The composition in which the top is repeated always surely raises this album-quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for "Suite:For The End Of An Age", Spacey's sound twines from the explosion of a free tempo round an intermittent rhythm. The song of Kabir Ghani twines round the rhythm of the rhythm of five. The tune might be very ..Spacey.. Jazz/Fusion/Prog Rock. The tune combines the rhythms of 7 and 5 from complex development and advances in fast Passage. Development is very progressive. In addition, the tune shifts from the development of the rhythm in close relation to the complexity to the piano. The flow of the float in the space suddenly shifts to the rhythm of 12 and rushes into the Spacey part. The tune returns to the first theme and reaches the peak. They will never get tired by the flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Remember" starts by a solemn piano melody. The sense of the melody of David Sancious might be splendid. The tune ..short composition.. has finished with the part of the intro. However, the concept of the album continues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And Then She Said" has the start where a progressive keyboard twines round a beautiful piano sound. It might be development where a good element of Jazz/Fusion is included. The sound in which the anacatesthesia is given is made and it becomes intense and advanced development is composed well as an idea. The method of Jazz/Fusion has been exactly taken well. Solo of Bass might be exactly straightening of Jeff Berlin. The composition that returns from solo of Bass to the theme is also splendid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Again Part 2" that decorates the end of the album is a sequel of "Again", too. A gentle piano theme touches it with a grand impression. Grand flow by the chorus's introduction. And, a perfect idea and it is technological of David Sancious. They might have completed the album. (From Progarchives)
