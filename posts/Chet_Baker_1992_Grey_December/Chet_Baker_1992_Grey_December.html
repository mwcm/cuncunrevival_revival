   Grey December is a collection of tracks that jazz trumpeter Chet Baker recorded in 1953 and 1955, early in his career. Baker had formed his own quartet with pianist Russell Freeman in 1953. Thirteen of the 17 tracks here are from 1953, and were recorded with a septet -- Baker's quartet plus three saxophonists, including Jack Montrose, who wrote many of the tunes and all the ensemble's arrangements. The latter are complex, without much room for improvisation, but quite beautiful, and feature Baker stating the melody in his trademark simple, lyrical way with the subtlest twists and turns.

   Highlights include a smoking and almost avant-garde take on Hoagy Carmichael's "Little Old Lady," which is presented here with an additional alternate take, as is Gordon Jenkins' inspired and moody "Goodbye." The first four tracks are from 1955, and feature Baker singing ballads against a backdrop of strings. Baker's vocals are, as usual, disarmingly simple, delivered in conversational phrases that stick closely to the melody.

   Nice gloomy collection of Baker tunes, perhaps a little disjointed but still featuring a nice balance of vocal ballads and generally more upbeat instrumental tracks. Not really a "best of" but still a decent compilation.
