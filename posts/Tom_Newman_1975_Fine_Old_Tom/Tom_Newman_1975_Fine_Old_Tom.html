   Born in 1943 in the United Kingdom, Tom Newman has a varied career as musician, collaborator, composer and producer. He initially started with the band called Playboy formed in the early 60's playing mainly R &amp; B and skiffle sounds. this line up went on to form the band July and had some measurable success in Europe, particularly Spain.Their self titled release is still one of the most highly, valuable sort after albums of the late 60's.Following July's breakup in 1969 Newman began working as a guitar session player and solo recording artist.

   In the early 1970's Tom Newman became resident and prime builder of Richard Branson's Virgin Manor Studio's in Oxford and began working, producing/collaborating with Mike Oldfield on the Tubualr Bells project. Enthusiasts of Mike Oldfield will fondly recall great moments these two artists shared alongside another well known personality, Vivian Stanshall making the album. After a single studio album at Virgin, Newman signed up with Decca for his much praised Faerie Symphony after starting his own studio called Argonaut in 1976. Faerie Symphony was regarded by some pundits to be one of the last true progressive LP's to come out in the 70's.

   Tom Newman was one of the more enduring talents to come out of the orbit of the psychedelic group July, but his history went back much farther than that band. Born in 1943, he was in his early teens when rock &amp; roll hit in England, and by the late '50s was in a skiffle outfit called the Playboys, who turned to rock &amp; roll and R&amp;B during the early '60s and took the new name, first the Thoughts and then the Tomcats, whose membership -- Tony Duhig on lead guitar and vocals, Jon Field on percussion and vocals, Chris Jackson on drums, and Newman on lead vocals, guitar, and keyboards -- later became the lineup of July. In the interim, they hit in Spain with a series of Spanish language covers, but returned to England during the psychedelic era and adapted to the new sound with a change of name to July. That group lasted for the duration of a single and a superb and very hard-to-find album. Following July's breakup in 1969, Newman went on to a dual career as a session guitarist and solo recording artist, and in the early '70s hooked up with Mike Oldfield, playing on Tubular Bells, and was signed to Richard Branson's Virgin Records label, for which he built Manor Studios. After a single solo studio venture there, he jumped ship from Virgin and subsequently recorded an ambitious solo album, Faerie Symphony, on which he reteamed with his former July bandmate Jon Field. Newman founded his own studio, Argonaut, in 1976, which became his primary vehicle for his own recordings, often with Field and Fred Frith, although he did sign with Decca Records in 1977 to release Faerie Symphony, one of the last unabashedly progressive rock long-players to come out of England during an era when the music had definitely gone out of fashion. In the years since, Newman has followed his own star, recording material that ranges from quasi-New Age ambient sound to sing-along numbers.

   Longtime producer/engineer for Mike Oldfield and many others, Tom Newman displays his creative chops on this, his first solo effort. A real sleeper, Fine Old Tom is a relatively obscure yet refreshing original pop/prog-rock project constructed by Newman and his pals, with Jon Field, Mike Oldfield, Ned Callan, Chris Cutler and Fred Frith in the starring roles. Everything on this eclectic album is done with original style and vigor to spare, convention being left by the wayside. Even Newman's cover of Lennon/McCartney's "She Said She Said" is inventive. Beatles influences are obvious in several of the pop-oriented compositions. Album highlights include the energetic "Nursery Rhyme," a prog piece with cynical lyrics and blistering guitar, and the excellent "Superman," a reggae-meets-punk experiment.

   Overall, this album is really fun to listen to. You can practically experience many varieties of styles from one song to the next: from soul, blues, rock n' roll to folk, boogie, country... Interestingly enough is the fact that many good and reknown musicians such as Fred Firth, Chris Butler, Mick Taylor and his friend Mike Oldfield participate in this album. At the end it is clear that they all got together to experiment, to jam and - the very basic intention of music - HAVE FUN! They transmit that happiness throughout the whole album.

   Analysing some of the songs, let's begin with "Suzie" which has a style of soul and blues, a dramatic sound that is carried well by the guitar and the lead singer; "Poor Bill" lifts the beat to a more rock n' roll style; once again, good solos. I felt like listening to those classic rock performers or bands such as Rory Gallagher, or Family. "Ma Song" is a funny old-blues-style tune, with the sound of metallic guitars, but very experimental. The sound and the instruments were recorded as if you were listening to them in the 20's or 30's, suddenly the voice have a bizarre twist, very experimental. "Penny's Whistle Boogie", well, the name tells you everything; it's an instrumental boogie piece, if you like Canned Heat, definitely this song will be fine for you. "She said, she said" a cover from The Beatles with a more folk style combined with Canterbury scene; the voices are the core of the whole tune, and in the background some hindi percussions that complement it. "Sad Sing" has a beat style, definitely portraying the origins and influence of bands such as Herman Hermits, Beatles, etc. The next song is "Superman", a very strange jazzy tune with saxophone, and a good happy rhythm with all the instruments, and funny voices singing the lyrics and choruses. "Alison Says" goes back to experimentation and the voices play again the most relevant part of the tune; voices singing different tonalities, which reminded me of "We Have Heaven" by Jon Anderson in Yes's Fragile album or the whole Ollias of Sunhilow. The last track "Day of the Percherons" is a complete folk song - just the name paves the way for the music - with a combination of instruments like celtic flutes, tambourine, drums, beautiful choirs, and folk guitar arrangements; I loved this tune because I love Mike Oldfield and Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn are two of my favourite albums. Also, this tune is what probably made Tom Newman go on with a more folk prog style in his next albums. There are other songs included in the album, such as "Ham and Eggs", "Sweet 16" which are folk country songs, quite enjoyable or "Have Mercy on My Eyes" which is another boogie blues song.

   Is it PROGRESSIVE? Well, if you separate song by song you will discover that only a couple of them have progressive hints, more oriented to folk prog, that is why Newman is considered as a "Crossover Prog" artist. One thing I am sure about is that it is full of experimentation and it is highly enjoyable because the songs are different from each other. Probably not highly essential or excellent in prog terms, but definitely is one of those albums that I would be very happy to add to my collection for the people that play in it, for the representation of Tom Newman (and the others)'s background.
