  The way Subotnick and others operating in the very same niche ‘related’ to that heritage, turned their music into a special blend of electronic music. Whereby, the complexity of atonal rationalities, rather than central, worked as a coaxial influence, which was pragmatically acknowledge, but with which Subotnick would not conceptually clinch. It was a welcomed ‘visitor’, who would be invited in, eat and drink but with whom, bizarrely enough, one would neither engage in conversation nor lock eyes with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One the conspicuous outcome of such an attitude was an atonal coated naïveté that makes Morton’s electro-butterflies exceedingly cute, and the patterns of their erratic sonic flights mostly charming. What the butterflies as compositions lack in insight -- which could definitely have been reinvigorated had Subotnik engaged in explicit dialogue with atonality – they excel in aural lightness and candid inconsistencies that only increase their soothing, colourful (not to be confounded with chromatic) spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last but not least, and never in detriment to Subotnick’s “Silver Apples of the Moon”, of which I am a fan, I do consider the latter a prelude to “4 Butterflies”. Then again, let them electric insects dream about and feast on old lunar apples. Meanwhile we enjoy the noise they make while daydreaming…
