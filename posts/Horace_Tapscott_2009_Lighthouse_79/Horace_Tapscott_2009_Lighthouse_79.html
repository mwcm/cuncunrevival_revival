  I would recommend getting this recording for "Leland's Song", even if the rest sucked, which it most definitely doesn't.  Horace Tapscott was a mad genius!  That song is so good that I can't help but laugh several times from pure enjoyment when he gets grooving. You don't want it to end, and it doesn't.  It keeps going for almost 19 minutes.  It's one of my all-time favorite songs for sure, even it doesn't sound as tight as it could be.  They obviously didn't rehearse that song very much.  Another point of interest is that this concert also features Horace Tapscott's take on "I Remember Clifford", which is not even remotely an avant-garde song.
