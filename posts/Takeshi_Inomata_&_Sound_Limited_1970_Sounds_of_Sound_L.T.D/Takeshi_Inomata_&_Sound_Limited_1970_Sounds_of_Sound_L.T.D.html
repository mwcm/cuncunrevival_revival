  Takeshi INOMATA, currently known as one of the most renowned and most influential jazz drummers in Japan, was born at Takarazuka, Japan in 1936. His father (an oboist of Takarazuka Revue Company), his elderly brother (a genius jazz trumpeter), and The Benny Goodman Orchestra whose album he had again and again listened to in his teenaged days could influence much on him and as a result he appeared on stage as a drummer at age 16. His terrific talent and enthusiasm for drumming surprisingly improve and develop his technique, that could let himself win the prize of Swing Journal Magazine's newcomer award in 1957. He showed his ability of jazz drumming in US Camps (later he mentioned he had played drums with smell of butter and hamburger steaks around him) and joined for a jazz outfit Westliners, but an enthusiasm that he wanted to play borderless music made him form SOUND L.T.D. (Limited), a progressive jazz-rock outfit. In those days such a mysterious and perverse creation might confuse every rock &amp; jazz fan and reviewer. Now Takeshi makes a large contribution toward training younger jazz musicians and making a record of the history of Japanese jazz, and simultaneously stands on many worldwide stages , e.g. Carnegie Hall or Apollo Theater.
