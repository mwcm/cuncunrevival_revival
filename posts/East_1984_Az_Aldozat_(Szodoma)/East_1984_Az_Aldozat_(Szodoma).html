   Nice album of this Hungarian band. One of the most finest bands of East Europe with a powerfull sound. This album have a great percussion and drums work and is not necessary some drums solos for we see how good is the stuff. Very spacey with a strong keiboards that made a powerfull context in music and some guitar parts that we can remember some Floydian sounds. I like this work that are very balanced, and the instrumental part made all universe of Szodoma. 5 tracks when the first and the last , (Szodoma and Pustulás) the more extensive, made some Psychedelic Space Rock and I think that this work is not Neo Prog in most of this parts. Excelente adiction in East Europe collection and one of the best works of this band.

   A transitional album of the great Hungarian prog heroes: the old line-up was almost split up but they haven’t been teamed up with Takáts yet.

   This is not a regularly progressive rock record but music composed for a ballet performed in progressive rock vein. The sound is very traditional: the record sounds similar to the debut Játékok the synthetic sound present on the two succeeding albums is not apparent here. Not only the sound reminds to the first album but also some of the musical themes have been heard on Játékok. Those who liked their first album will definitely enjoy this.

   This is a completely instrumental album and very functional as music. The closing track is a revised repetition of the opening ‘Sodom’, slightly in the vein of ‘Fanfare for the Common Man’, both seem to run too long. The tracks in between are generally moderate in tempo and more interesting. The two standouts are ‘Women’s Lament’ and the beautiful ‘Lea’ which is clearly the record’s best moment with the guitar work within. ‘Auction’ is an ambient like piece which is very functional, while ‘Dance of Course’ is in the vein of the first and last track with more energy.

   I would say Sodom is a very good album since East for me is still a standout act of Hungarian progressive rock. On the other hand something is missing here: a short material where almost half of the running time is occupied by the first and last track. That’s why I recommend this one for fans and collectors only.
