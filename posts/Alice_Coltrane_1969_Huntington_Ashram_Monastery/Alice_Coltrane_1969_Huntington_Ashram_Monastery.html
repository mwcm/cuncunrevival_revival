   Extracts from liner notes:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Ashram means 'hermitage'. Of the many humanly-constructed ashrams and monasteries throughout the world, I feel that the real ashram is in your heart...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   ...'Turiya' is a state of consciousness. It is regarded as the high state of Nirvana, the goal of human life...
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   ...IHS means 'I Have Suffered'. It exemplifies the sufferings and tribulations of mankind in general. According to Eastern thought, suffering is a gift from God. Certain individuals suffer to a greater extent, more than others, depending upon Karma (action in general). The highest of these individuals are those who sacrifice themselves for humanity and love of God".

   Composer, pianist, keyboard player, harpist and bandleader Alice (McLeod) Coltrane married John Coltrane in 1965. She played in her husband's band until his passing in 1967 but his influence remained strong throughout her music thereafter. Few of her albums reflect this influence more strongly than Huntington Ashram Monastery, recorded in 1969
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Huntington captures a trio date with bassist Ron Carter and drummer Rashied Ali, who picked up for Elvin Jones in John Coltrane's band and helped propel 'Trane into his most "free" jazz. Its title track, originally composed as a solo harp piece, and "Parmahansa Lake" pivot their internal (meditative) and external (exploratory) faces upon the fulcrum of Carter's repetitive, throbbing bass, even though their swirling movements and rhythms, especially from Coltrane's harp, sound static, nearly floating. "I am especially pleased with Ron Carter's playing on this album," she wrote in Monastery's original notes. "His ears are harmonically attuned to higher chord progressions."

   Coltrane moves from harp to piano for "Via Sivanandager" and "Jaya Jaya Rama" and the piano's less heavenly, more temporal sound seems to root them in more earthly styles. The spiritual overtones, and multiplicity and sheer volume of her notes, impart such majestic jazz power to "Via Sivanandager" that the comparison to McCoy Tyner, another of her husband's most famous sidemen, seems almost too evident. Her piano roots "Jaya Jaya Rama" in the blood, sweat and tears of the blues.

   This is the rare occasion of an Alice Coltrane trio album, and it provides a more intimate look at her music than most of the other albums from this period, many of which sounded like the John Coltrane band without Coltrane.

   On side A, Alice Coltrane does an exercise in abstract impressionism, weaving ethereal sound tapestries on her harp while Ron Carter works his bass like a water pump. The semantic link to New Age music is definitely there, but Coltrane's music is simply too abstract and angular to please anyone who would expect anything melodic.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On side B, she does an exercise in abstract expressionism, this time on the piano, and it seems almost as if she's pointing out the way that piano solos would take on 20-30 years later. This is perfectly up to date music, with only a slight hint of late 60s hippiedom, but firmly rooted and full of expressive emotion.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In fact, this album borders so much on modern classical music that it may surprise first-time listeners, who, I guess, expected something very different from John Coltrane's wife. This is unlike most of her other albums, and it probably hasn't been properly reissued on CD for this very reason, but it's by no means an album that can be neglected.
