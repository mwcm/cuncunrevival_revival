   McCoy Tyner's albums from the late 1960s sound as if he was searching for something. He had found a place in John Coltrane's quartet, only to then find that Coltrane was developing farther and farther at an incredible pace, leaving Tyner stranded somewhere on the way. Tyner's string of albums for Blue Note - even good ones, such as The Real McCoy or the present Expansions feel oddly transitional, and it would only be on his excellent albums for Milestone from 1972 onwards that he seemed to have found a place in which he was really comfortable.

   On Expansions, he is trying to expand sounds, melodies, harmonies and approaches, but despite excellent sidemen like Woody Shaw, Gary Bartz and Wayne Shorter, something is amiss, and he never ventures very far from a loose form of post-bop, a kind of music that doesn't feel all that up to date in 1969.

   Still, "Visions" and "Song of Happiness" are as commanding and involving as any of his tracks from this period; Tyner certainly hadn't lost it, he was simply searching, and it wouldn't take him long to find it.

   "Expansions" is one of my favorite McCoy albums of all time (although I don't know if anything will ever top "The Real McCoy" for me). "Expansions" has some of my favorite McCoy compositions of all time like "Peresina" and "Vision." Plus the album was recorded by Van Gelder and produced by Duke Pearson. McCoy, Woody and Wayne are absolutely KILLING on this album.

   I have to address one of the the other reviewers who wrote that "Vision" has a "corny funk-jazz head." This is just uninformed. "Vision" is pure sixties modal jazz. It does have a straight beat, but it certainly isn't trying to be funky. And, the solos on this tune are anything but "profoundly dull," unless by profoundly dull, you mean amazing.

   As for the recording quality, it is a little fuzzier than Van Gelder's earlier stuff, but that was the fad in the late 60's early 70's. And, yes Ron Carter's arco playing leaves a lot to be desired, especially on "I Thought I'd Let You Know," but it's not enough to take away from the fact that this is a fantastic album. Highly recommended!
