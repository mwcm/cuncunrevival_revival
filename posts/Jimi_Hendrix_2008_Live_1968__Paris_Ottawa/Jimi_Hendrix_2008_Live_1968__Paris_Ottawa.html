   The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Live In Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968 is the 10th release in the long-running Dagger Records series of official ‘bootleg’ style recordings from Experience Hendrix. Live In Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968 presents two fiery live performances that highlight Jimi Hendrix’s rapdily evolving music repertoire as the rock trio embarked on a worldwide tour in support of their sophomore release, Axis: Bold As Love.

   The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Live In Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968 kicks off with a rousing performance at Paris, France’s famed L’Olympia Theatre. The January 29, 1968 performance marked the third time The Jimi Hendrix Experience had performed at the venue in just over a year; having first made their French debut as a support act with legendary French vocalist Johnny Halliday in October 1966.

   Originally released as part of the 1991 4CD box set Stages, The Jimi Hendrix Experience’s L’Olympia Theatre performance makes it’s return engagement to CD for the first time in more than 15 years. Like all previous recordings in the Dagger Records library, Live In Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968 is once again highlighted by posthumous studio engineering and mastering by our dynamic technical team of Eddie Kramer and George Marino.

   The Experience’s Paris performance features nine fiery recordings, including two rousing Blues classics “Killing Floor” and “Catfish Blues;” six unforgettable live performances featuring some of Jimi Hendrix’s most celebrated self-penned compositions including “Foxey Lady,” “Red House,” “The Wind Cries Mary,” “Fire,” “Little Wing” and the ageless “Purple Haze;” plus “Drivin’ South,” a composition Hendrix first recorded and performed in 1965 while serving as one of R&amp;B/Soul musician, Curtis Knight’s young guitarists.

   The release of this celebrated January 1968 performance at L’Olympia Theatre is the perfect companion release with Dagger Records’ sixth CD release The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Paris 1967 / San Francisco 1968 (originally released in April 2003), which featured The Experience’s October 9, 1967 show at the same venue.

   In addition to The Experience’s French performance, Live In Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968 is rounded out with the inclusion of three previously unreleased live recordings of The Jimi Hendrix Experience performing in concert at the Capitol Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The three, previously unreleased songs represented here include The Beatles’ hit single “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” along with two classic Hendrix anthems including “Fire” and “Purple Haze.” These new recordings were taped during The Experience’s first show on the evening of March 19, 1968 and are sourced from a previously undiscovered tape.

   Recordings from The Experience’s second show on March 19, 1968 in Ottawa was the subject of Dagger Records’ fourth release The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Live In Ottawa and combine nicely with this new release to round out any Hendrix fan’s music library.
