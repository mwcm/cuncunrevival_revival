  Guitarist Eric Gale made his reputation as a session guitarist during the late 60's and 70's for a host of different artists, as well as being a key member of the jazz/funk group Stuff. As part of Sony's Contemporary Masters series, they've put two of Eric Gale's best solo albums together on one CD. "Gingeng Woman" released in 1977 and it's 1978 follow up "Multiplication" were both produced by Bob James and feature excellent support players like Steve Gadd, Ralph McDonald, Grover Washington, Jr., Anthony Jackson, and Richard Tee. Standout tracks from "Ginseng Woman" include "Red Ground", and his cover of Hall &amp; Oates "Sara Smile". "Multiplication's" best cuts include his cover of Lee Ritenour's "Morning Glory" and the traditional "Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child". His later work in the 80's and early 90's occasionally matched the peak he reached with these two albums. Sadly he passed away in 1994 and much of his solo output is out of print. But fortunately these two albums are available, and are most definitely worth checking out.
