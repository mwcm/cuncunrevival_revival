  Their second album, released in 1978 and named On with the action, show same approach to the jazzy progressive attitude from previous album but also , first lights of what to come in next years.The melodic arrangements , the one who almost go on pop side are well meted with the rest of the jazzy ones, special on track like Get up or Moonlight grotesque. An OK album, Less intersting then their first but still pleasant all the way. Quite a hard to find release , never being issued on CD like self titled and for that is very unnoticed to larger public, still good moments combined with more directly heavy prog in places atmosphere. 3 star for this one, not much to talk about this release, OK but nothing more, the best they ever done is the first one. After this release they folded and disbanded in 1980, but as well they revive few years ago and doing concerts in a big form showing that they are still alive and doing well. Great band that for some reasons never got the attention they deserve. Can be check their web page, there are some very interesting pictures, audio files and everything from the band and other bands where members were involved.
