  "Every record company should have its own Melanie if it wants one; now A&amp;M has its. Whatever does it for you." M.A. (Morgan Ames) [High Fidelity, Nov. 1973, p. 155]
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Cheryl Dilcher, A. &amp; M. have Franc's female counterpart. It's possible that she could have made more impact if Melanie, whom she resembles vocally, hadn't got there first. Still, she has the redoubtable Jeff Barry producing her--which could help her on her way. In the meantime she just about deserves A:2 for her efforts, which she can share with Peter Franc." [Hi Fi News &amp; Record Review, Dec. 1973, p. 2633.]

  "While butterflies and kittens cavort on the album jacket, Cheryl spews up enough musical sugar to kill a nation of diabetics. There's even a cutesie butterfly mask to wear when you listen to the album and run around outside your house in your skivvies. A&amp;M should have thrown in a luger for good measure. Maybe if we all wish REEEL hard, this'll go away." [Circus, Oct. 1973, p. 53.]

  From Allentown, Pennsylvania, a pretty hippy folk/pop singer/songwriter who began in the coffee
  <br/>
  circuit. Some of her songs were included in the Hippie Goddesses CD compilation but her albums
  <br/>
  on A&amp;M and Butterfly are quite lame.

   Though there's no denying namesake Cheryl Dilcher was cute, when I stumbled across this album at a yardsale I didn't have a clue who she was.  As a result I bought the album based on the Jeff Barry connection.  In carrying a dedicated to Barry, he produced this album and was credited with playing percussion throughout.

   Judging by the title and cutesy packaging (butterflies, kittens, etc.) my initial thoughts were that 1973's "Butterfly" was liable to be little more than a collection of cloyingly earnest singer/songwriter tracks; maybe something along the lines of early Janis Ian, Melanie, or Carly Simon.  The other thought was that this would turn out to be throwaway pop - Barry having found a cute, young woman whom he was willing to mentor for awhile.  Well, technically I wasn't completely wrong with the initial assessment.  Listening to the album it turned out that Dilcher actually did sound a bit like a slightly pissed off  Melanie and on tracks like 'Sweet Mama', 'Rainbow Farm' and 'So Sad' her material could have been mistaken for something off of one of Melanie's mid-1970s albums (check out side two's 'Irma' or 'Chocolate Candy' if you doubt the comparison). Like Melanie, Dilcher owned a deep and raspy voice that wasn't the most musical thing you ever heard, but proved to be well suited to her material and grew on you with a couple of spins.   Similarly I wasn't completely off target with respect to Jeff Barry's influence.  Though all twelve tracks were Dilcher originals and nothing here was overtly bubblegum, Barry's commercial touch was evident throughout the set.

   Unknown to me at the time, this one's generated a cult following among psych collectors.  Turns out that 'High' and 'All Woman' were included in a bootleg compilation entitled "Hippie Goddesses".  While it's easy to see why they were included (fuzz guitar and a far more rock oriented attack than the rest of the set), musically those tracks were quite atypical.  Too bad, since they were amongst the collection's standout performances.
