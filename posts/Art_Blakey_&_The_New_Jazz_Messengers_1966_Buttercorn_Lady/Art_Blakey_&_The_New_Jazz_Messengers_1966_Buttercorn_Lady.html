    The album is notable for being the first commercial recording featuring pianist Keith Jarrett, who had joined Blakey’s band a few months earlier. This album is also the only recorded collaboration between Blakey and Jarrett. For more than three decades Art Blakey has been introducing new young jazz talent to the world. The list of notable musicians who have come to prominence in his bands includes, among many others, Clifford Brown, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, and Wynton Marsalis.

    Heard on this album is a short-lived mid-60’s edition of Blakey’s Messengers which included two musicians who later went on to achieve huge international success: the aforementioned Jarrett and trumpeter Chuck Mangione. Also featured here is Frank Mitchell, an obscure but excellent tenor saxophonist who later recorded for Blue Note with Lee Morgan.

    By all accounts, Blakey did not appreciate having a bossa nova (“Pensativa”) thrust upon him at the Free for All session in ’64. But as this 1966 live date shows, it wasn’t because he couldn’t do Latin or Caribbean rhythms. “Buttercorn Lady” is a calypso by the Messengers’ newest trumpeter, Chuck Mangione, and the drummer holds the beat with a repeating “splish” sound on his ride cymbal and blithe tom accents. Bassist Reggie Johnson comes merrily along with him, Mangione and tenor saxophonist Frank Mitchell adding occasional, playful fills. The tune has only one solo, by 19-year-old Keith Jarrett (announced by Mangione with a quick little trumpet fanfare), who’s already brimming with ideas and bluesy turns. He would defect to Charles Lloyd’s band within a few weeks of this Los Angeles date, making Buttercorn Lady a document of one of Blakey’s more obscure and ephemeral lineups.

    Few jazz followers would think of trumpeter Chuck Mangione and pianist Keith Jarrett as former members of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, but in 1966, they both worked in the drummer's classic hard bop unit and the stint gave them needed exposure and helped the pair to develop their own individual voices. With tenor saxophonist Frank Mitchell and bassist Reggie Workman completing the quintet, this particular version of The Jazz Messengers only had the opportunity to record this one excellent live LP (which is currently out of print) but proved to be a worthy successor to their more acclaimed predecessors.
