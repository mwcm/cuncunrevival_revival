  Another little-known band from Holland,who's rare works "Gamma" (1972) and "Darts" (1974) definitely worth a spin.They were formed in 1970 by their leader organist/pianist Paul Poulissen and actually they worked more like a session group than a full-time band,as Poulissen is the only musician presented on both of their albums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their first release,entitled ''Alpha'',came out in 1973 and GAMMA's music can be defined as a mixed bag of brass rock and soft orchestral prog rock,bringing to mind bands like EKSEPTION (for the dominent horn section) and FOCUS (for the flute-driven classical-inspired passages).The musicianship is very nice,showing a band with talent and potential,but what actually spoils the whole effort are the unbearable vocals of Frans Te Spenke,who sings like if he was a singer coming out of a low-budget musical.Fortunately the album is mostly instrumental,ranging from brass-rock parts with horns and saxes and jazzy inteplays with piano/bass/drums on the front and JAN AKKERMAN-like guitars to classical soft instrumental themes with great flute work and and the awaited early 70's sound of slight psychedelic doses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ''Alpha'' won't blow your mind,but it is certainly an decent but lost progressive work of the Dutch scene,which will definitely reward your efforts to purchase it.
