   This set documents the four-night stand by John Coltrane (sax) and his quintet at the Village Vanguard in New York City, November 1 -- 5, 1961. Although these are not newly discovered tapes -- as the majority of the selections have turned up on no less than five separate releases -- their restoration is significant in assessing motifs in Coltrane's [read: multi-show] live appearances. Coltrane is accompanied by an all-star ensemble of Eric Dolphy (alto sax/bass clarinet), Garvin Bushell (oboe/contrabassoon), Ahmed Abdul-Malik (oud), McCoy Tyner (piano), Jimmy Garrison (bass), Reggie Workman (bass), Elvin Jones (drums), and Roy Haynes (drums). Their presence is as equally vital as Coltrane's -- inspiring as well as informing the dimensions of improvisation. With the knowledge that the entire run was being documented to create some sort of retail document, Coltrane chose nine specific compositions to concentrate on. The choice of material likewise had a tremendous impact on the personnel of the band -- evidenced by Bushnell's contributions during "Spiritual" and Abdul-Malik's within the context of the extended "India." Each set bears its own distinctive shading and emphasis. Parties wishing to hear the run in its entirety are encouraged to check out the multi-disc Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings (1997) as there are multiple takes of the same songs. This allows even the most unsophisticated jazz consumer the opportunity to note the difference in the various versions, while contrasting the player's widely diverse performance styles. The highly recommended box set also includes a nine-panel fold out poster, 48-page liner notes booklet -- with a complete discography for the included material -- and other ephemera, such as rarely published photographs.

   Coltrane's made so many live albums that I can't blame you for being a little confused as to which ones are essential and which ones aren't. I'll have a list about that up eventually, but in the meantime, I'll tell you this: if you only get one, make it this one. It's of that rare breed of live album that isn't just really, really nice to have around, but absolutely cannot be done without. It's an absolutely essential piece of the picture, not just for Coltrane's career, but for jazz in general.

   I mean, will anyone argue with me if I say that free jazz as we know it began with "Chasin' the Trane?" Now, I know that Ornette Coleman pioneered the genre, and I'm definitely not going to step on his achievements - I did write a novel named after Free Jazz's subtitle ("A Collective Improvisation," FYI [that novel blows. Fuck that novel]), so you know I'm a fan - but the levels of spiritual intensity that are present in the works of Pharaoh Sanders, Albert Ayler, etc. aren't found there, or at least not to the degree that they're found on "Chasin' the Trane." It's easily one of Coltrane's best pieces ever. It's also, on an objective level, one of the most self-indulgent things I've ever heard. It's basically just Trane soloing for sixteen consecutive minutes. But the solo is breathtaking. Seriously, the man does everything you can possibly do with a saxophone there, and some things that I thought you couldn't do. I've never heard anyone approach the instrument like Coltrane does, which is probably why I'm such a big fan in the first place.

   And those other two aren't too shabby either, are they? "Spiritual" is just as mind-blowing as "Chasin' the Trane." It's a riveting, appropriately prayer-like song that offers more and more to me every time I hear it. So much emotion, so much texture, so much raw, unfettered emotion... holy shit. I mean, even the worst song here is still brilliant in its own way - "Softly as in a Morning Sunrise," despite having a lovely piano solo and great interplay between Trane and my man Eric Dolphy, just can't stack up to the other two massive tunes it's positioned in between. But then, what could? It's still an awesome song in its own right, after all.

   Speakin' of Dolphy, certain editions of this come with "Impressions" and "India" as bonus tracks, and that really solidifies this as a five-star in my mind. If you're looking for a version of this, but don't feel like splurging on The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings, try to find that one. Actually, since that version is sadly out of print (Live at the Village Vanguard: The Master Takes is its name, for those with easy access to out-of-print stuff), I'd recommend you snatch up a copy of Impressions and make yourself a playlist of the songs contained here plus "Impressions" and "India." Because those two are absolutely fantastic in their own right. Armed with little more than his trusty bass clarinet, Dolph actually upstages Trane on "India," turning it into a hypnotic, fascinating experience that inspired the Byrds to write "Eight Miles High," while "Impressions" uses the "So What" groove as the launch pad for a dizzying sax duel between John and Eric. That is, in my opinion, the best way to hear this album outside of the boxed set.

   What else can I say, really? It's a highlight even for the Coltrane discography, and since Coltrane is my single favorite musician, that is quite a statement coming from me. If you have even a passing interest in jazz, you need to pick this up as soon as you can.
