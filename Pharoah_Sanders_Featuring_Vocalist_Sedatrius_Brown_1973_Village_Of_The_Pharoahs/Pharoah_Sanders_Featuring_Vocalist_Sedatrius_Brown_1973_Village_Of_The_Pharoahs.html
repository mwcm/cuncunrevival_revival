   Raise your hand if you’ve been holding out hope that more of Pharoah Sanders’ early ‘70s catalog would finally get remastered and/or released for the first time on CD.

   Anyone? Well, there weren’t necessarily people clamoring for this music even during the era it was made. But certainly more people had at least heard of Pharoah Sanders. Then again, more people had heard of jazz then. Therein lies the beauty of this music (jazz in general and Sanders in particular): it was not created with commercial intent and no jazz musician ever becomes a professional expecting to make an easy living.

   Not much has changed in the last four decades, except that the audience, already diminished due to generational shifts and the full ascendancy of rock music, has shrunk considerably. And that’s okay: the important thing is that this music was made, and it is still available for the cultivated ears that crave it. Since two of Sanders’ lesser-known recordings are getting the official reissue treatment, it’s certainly cause for celebration, or at least recognition.

   If you are remotely inquisitive or, better yet, have been on the lookout for this material, now’s the time to leap in, as Impulse has included Sanders in their ongoing “two-fer” reissues, wherein you get two full-length albums for the price of one. Considering the prices of import-only versions of some of these albums have been fetching in recent years, this is miraculous news for completists. Needless to say, Impulse is typically on top of their game: all the tracks sound immaculate and it is considerable cause for joy to see them receive the TLC of today’s technological advancements.

   it’s worth asking how this music stacks up with what is being made today. In this writer’s opinion, it holds up quite nicely indeed. The centerpiece of Village of The Pharoahs is the three-part title suite, which stretches over 16 minutes. It comes crashing (and conga-ing) out of the gate and establishes a good groove, never losing its momentum while also managing to avoid the indulgence that tended to mar some of this era’s work (including Sanders’). This is the work of a confident explorer willing to go anywhere and do anything, and a cursory glance at any of Sanders’ unsmiling album covers from this period makes the conditions clear: strap in and come along for the ride because once we start we aren’t slowing down.

   Village Of The Pharoahs is certainly not Pharoah Sanders finest moment, but I just don’t get the negative reviews I’ve seen on various sites regarding it. What I think some reviewers have against it is that it’s much more Pharoah Sanders performing as part of a band, as opposed to him being the master of the album, like on the powerhouse noise-fests of his earlier Impulse recordings. Also, this album is quite a lot less free than his more noted Impulse works like Karma and Black Unity.  What you do get on here, in place of his famed screech and free aural onslaught style, is much more of a solid driving rhythm, almost a slight touch of funk, but with all the depth and spirituality you’d expect from a Pharoah Sanders album.

   Side one of this album is four tracks (“Village of the Pharoahs Pts. 1 – 3” and “Myth”) played as one unbroken piece, and I have to say that this is close to one of the most magical musical moments I’ve ever sat through.  This side is a mix of driving bass, supplied by Calvin Hill, with a simmering current of Middle Eastern/African melodies gorgeously laid-down by Kylo Kylo.  As with most Pharoah Sanders Impulse work, a deliciously hypnotic cacophony engulfs you for the duration of the recording.  My only fault with the music on this side is that Pharoah Sanders has used Sedatrius Brown as the vocal/percussionist as opposed to Leon Thomas.  Not wanting to be disrespectful to Sedatrius Brown, but Leon Thomas just has the edge in this style of free vocal work.

   Side two contains three individual tracks, which the latter two of these are where I think the albums gets let down. The first of the three (Mansion Worlds) is a bit of a bottom-end masterpiece that really sticks to the lower tones of the spectrum.  On this track both Cecil McBee and Stanley Clarke are on bass duties. Then you have the most delicate piano work from Joe Bonner, and an almost unobtrusive soprano sax from Pharoah Sanders. This tune is a very delicate and beautiful thing it’s almost fragile in its subtlety, and definitely a real high-point for me of Pharoah Sanders recorded work.  The last two tracks on here are pretty standard affairs, and a bit of a let down after the last thirty minutes of music you’ve just been wowed by. The penultimate track is an appreciation entitled “Memories of Lee Morgan” which obviously is a nod in the direction of the style of Lee Morgan. Lastly is an up-tempo rocking and bluesy crowd pleaser called “Went Like It Came” that for me was the real low point on this album.

   I did notice that one of the negative reviews I’d previously read of this album has just been changed from an apathetic one, to one of pure praise.  This could be because this album has just been reissued on CD and they wanted people to buy it from them.  Either that or they’ve finally got to hear it properly as opposed to just flicking through the second-hand vinyl copy I brought from them.

   Three quarters of the tracks on Village Of The Pharoahs are truly great musical moments and will be of interest to anyone who likes their music with a pulse. I will most certainly be re-visiting the first three quarters this album a lot.

   Often decried by Sanders purists, I find that the present Village is one of Pharoah’s more interesting work, especially that he tends to forget about the dissonant forays into free-jazz improves and concentrates on the up-tempo grooves. Maybe some tend to see this album as an end of an era, as this is one of his last works before a two years+ absence of new material and his change of label.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Opening on the wild 17-mins three-part suite title track, it is coming with some low-in-the-mix vocals/chants from Sedastrius Brown (who gets his name on the front and some wild African rhythms mixed with Indian influences and percussions. Of the usual Pharoah suspects on the A-side, you’ll only find pianist Bonner, but we’re still very much in the Coltrane sonic galaxy. A short Myth piece closes the suite in a minor fashion.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The flipside is sees regulars like bassist McBee and drummer Connor reappear (on top of Bonner’s contributions) and features second bassist Staley Clark (no “e”), but this writer can’t get his enthusiasm to rise to the level of the title track suite. This is particularly true for the 9-mins Mansion Worlds, a confused affair, where dynamics seem to have been dulled by the erosion of time, despite a bass duet ending the hostilities. Returning to an alice C sound, Memories is a rather tedious affair, missing its mark, and Bonner’s flute doesn’t hit the spot. As to the boogie-woogie closing piece, it is forgettable, despite presenting an unusual facet of Sanders.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mostly worthy of interest (IMHO) for the sidelong title track, the Village album indeed seems that we’re nearing the end of an era (which will happen with that two year gap and a change of label), but there is really nothing to tell us that it would happen when listening to the present. Maybe not Pharoah’s best, but it’s still worth throwing your ears on the vinyl grooves of this slice of wax.
