  Late-70's Swiss duo, established by keyboardist/vocalist Patrice Guenat and Henry Dubelly, who sung and was also tha main composer of the group.They recorded their debut ''Alarme!'' at the Mountain Studio in Montreux, mixed by David Richards (sound engineer for Queen, David Bowie, Yes).The album was released in 1979 on Kiswell in several European countries, later it was released under the title ''Je suis'' only for the Swiss market.

  Pitty that the production of the album is rather questionable, because ''Alarme!'' is a very good Electronic Rock album with strong influences by TANGERINE DREAM and JEAN MICHEL JARRE.Quite a bit of cosmic electronics, soaring synthesizers and pounding drums dominate most of the tracks, which contain also a fair amount of symphonic breaks, creating a grandiose and beautiful atmosphere.''Go!'' is propably the best example of Kashmir's style, a long and sonic Progressive Electronic piece of music with outlandish synths, nice choirs, Classical influences around the middle and heavy percussions, excellent work indeed.But there are also hints from more Classic Prog stylings in ''Alarme!''.The long ''Linear'' is characterized by some spacey synthesizers, psychedelic vocals, light organs and and good guitar solos, reminding a lot of PULSAR.''Far Away'' has a nice mellotron-flute and Avant-Garde piano lines, offering a sinister and unique atmosphere.''6 H 30'' contains excellent vocals and some very nervous synthesizers along with soft drumming to recall again PULSAR's sound.

  <br/>
  One the most underrated gems of Progressive Electronic Music.Atmospheric, cinematic, highly symphonic and emotional music all the way.Strongly recommended.
