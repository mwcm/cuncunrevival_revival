   Despite Leonard Feather's raves in the liner note of this CD reissue (which adds two additional selections to the original five-song LP), the music on this post-bop set by tenor saxophonist Harold Land is good but not great. The original five songs (four Land originals plus one by drummer Ndugu) have some dated electronics by keyboardist Bill Henderson and electric bassist Buster Williams (who does play his customary acoustic on some numbers) but also some fiery trumpeter from Oscar Brashear. None of the five originals are all that memorable, but there are some cooking moments, and Land takes a rare turn on oboe during "Pakistan." A similar group (with vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson in Brashear's place) performs the two extra tracks. The modal music, which clearly shows the influences of early fusion and funk, is interesting but very much of its period.

   Harold Land at his most spiritual – recording solo after a set of great albums with Bobby Hutcherson as a partner – but still very much in the same sort of unbridled energy! The tracks are soaring and open – and have Land's tenor really sounding nice and raw – amidst a lineup that includes Oscar Brashear on trumpet, Bill Henderson on piano, Buster Williams on bass, and Ndugu Chancler on drums and percussion! Henderson picks up Fender Rhodes at points – especially on the great funky cut "In The Back In The Corner In The Dark", which is one of the best-remembered tracks on the set. And Land also plays a bit of oboe on the cut "Pakistan", almost in a Yusef Lateef sort of style.
