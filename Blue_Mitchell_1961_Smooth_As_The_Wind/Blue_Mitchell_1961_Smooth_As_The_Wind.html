  When these recordings were made in early 60s, trumpeter Blue Mitchell was already a mature artist: a thoughtful musician with an individual voice, who had made a name with Horace Silvers quintet from 1958 onwards. Smooth as the Wind was a true hallmark in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trumpeter Blue Mitchell is in excellent form on this very interesting session that has been reissued on CD. Mitchell is accompanied by a brass section, a rhythm section, and strings. The arrangements (seven by Tadd Dameron and three from Benny Golson) are generally quite stimulating, inspiring the trumpeter to come up with many fresh melodic solos. The repertoire includes two songs that Mitchell played regularly with the Horace Silver Quintet, a pair of superior Tadd Dameron tunes (including the title cut), and six standards. By varying tempos and moods, Dameron and Golson helped create one of the better soloist-with-strings jazz dates.
