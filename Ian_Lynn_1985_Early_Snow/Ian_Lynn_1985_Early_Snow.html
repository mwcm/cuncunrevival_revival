   Largely unknown multi-instrumentalist from the UK. An early to mid 1980s instrumental cd mixing vibes, drums and keyboards. Not quite soft jazz and not quite new age either. A melting fusion of jazz and melodic instrumental music. Ian has a penchant for melodic hooks and really knows the fine art of using synthesizers as a painter utilizes a color wheel. All of his solo discs on the UK MMC label are very good and follow a sort of seasonal theme. Uplifting with the pine sap ruining your audio clear coat!!

   As its title suggests, Early Snow is decidedly more wintry in flavour, both compositionally and sonically, despite an expanded complement of instrumentation, now including the Roland Jupiter 8, Roland Vocoder Plus, Yamaha acoustic piano, flute and DX7 synthesizer, Premier vibes, Fender Rhodes electric piano, Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Hohner clavinet. Once again, Bob Jenkins plays drums and Martin Ditcham plays percussion, but with bass duties now in the hands of the redoubtable Mo Foster (check out his magnificent 1988 album Bel Assis) and (wordless) vocals c/o Basia. Oddly, though, despite Mo Foster's deserved reputation as a fine bass player, I prefer the sound of Ian Lynn's Rose Morris Westwood bass playing on Forgotten Summer.

   As was its predecessor, this album was written, arranged and produced by Ian Lynn, recorded at Front Room Recorders and Nivram Studios by Ian Lynn, Dennis Weinreich and Dick Plant and mixed by Dennis Weinreich in 1986.

   As a follow up to Forgotten Summer, Early Snow is a fair effort, once again (almost) entirely instrumental but it lacks the magical atmosphere and coherent, end-to-end flow of its predecessor, whilst its sound quality isn't as good either. But it's not at all bad, and worth having to complete the pairing.
