   "Escenes" is an album that never ceases to amaze me, revealing more intricate beauty over the years every time I hear it. It is one of the very best melodic instrumental Symphonic albums and it has a bit of a jazzy flavor as well in spots. This is a flute lovers dream as the flute and keys are the prevailing leads whereas guitars are used mostly as relish but to great effect when present. Drumming is crisp and inventive without ever being showy and the bass playing is solid.

   Emotion is every bit as important as technical prowess and Gotic exude emotion in melody even though they have a rather clean, reserved style on the surface. There is SO much care taken to crafting intricate and delicate melody you feel that nothing has been left to chance. This is one of those albums that just make me feel great joy at being alive and I can lock in directly with what the musicians were expressing, meaning they are successful with the prime objective.

   I De La Mar begins in a very upbeat moody with energetic flute and strong bass before calming into a dreamy sequence. "Escenes" is mostly an upbeat album but there are moments of calm reflection like here. It picks up again at close and then Imprompt continues with this theme of playful sparring by the musicians and these perfectly timed and very bright cymbal crashes. At about 4 minutes in we get a nice electric guitar solo before the flute and piano take over again. Jocs D'Ocells explores a haunting melancholy but also never lets the bright side get too far away. "Escenes" will show you brief glimpses of the dark side but it never wallows there, it wants to keep your heart joyful. The 10 minute closer Historia is the icing on the cake. It begins with lovely Steve Howe (circa TFTO) style acoustic guitar and soft, mournful flutes playing harmonies over each other. Beautiful. At 3.5 minutes we get some subdued aching electric guitar. Half way through the most effective and stunning part begins, this melody that is uplifting and telling you to have hope that all will be OK. That while the world is imperfect there are reasons to believe that life can be happy and secure again. This passage is pure joy that is right up there with the best moments of Camel or anyone else for that matter. What a finish!

   I experience many feelings listening to Escenes. There are passages that make one nostalgic for happy moments in the past, that make one remember old loves or childhood or a magical place. The artwork in the Fono tri-fold digipak is nothing short of stunning and perfectly compliments the music. This is one of those albums on my special shelf and one of the reasons why I love music so much. Quite recommended especially to flute fanatics and 70's Camel fans.

   The music on GOTIC's 1977 release "Escenes" surprised me at first. While I was expecting prog rock with strong Spanish influences and a dark "Gothic" sort of sound, what I got instead was optimistic-sounding instrumental music with a strong French-prog sound. GOTIC's light, yet complex, style of jazz-prog is mostly led by flute and Rhodes piano. Once in a while I hear Hammond organ, violin, and Moog synth, but the majority of the music is led by flute while the Rhodes piano sketches out countermelodies and jazzy chords underneath. After my second listen, this band reminded me of a less complex version of the French-Canadian band MANEIGE mixed with the flute-heavy riffs from French band DÜN (without the Zeuhl factor), and the jazzy sounds from Spain's ICEBERG around the time of "Coses Nostres". GOTIC put out one of the best albums from the Spanish prog scene of the late 70s. I wouldn't rate it as high as MEZQUITA, or ICEBERG's "Sentiments", but something about this music pushes it above FUSIOON's MINORISA and IMAN CALIFATO INDEPENDENTE..
