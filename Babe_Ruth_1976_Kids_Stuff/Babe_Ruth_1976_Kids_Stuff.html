  I may as well make it clear from the outset that this is easily my favourite Babe Ruth album. That will surprise and possibly disappoint many Babe Ruth fans as they mostly see it as the weakest with the main protagonists from the band departed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A brief explanation of how I came to purchase the album in the first place may explain all however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those of you that are old enough to remember the good old days of 'Record Shops' will know what I'm talking about here. The poor youngsters among you will just have to curse your bad luck for being born in a time of muti-national corporations where every High street in every town is exactly the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You see back in the seventies and eighties, and into the nineties too just about, things were very different. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda (Wal-mart) etc sold bread and cheese. If you wanted records you went to a record shop or in some places like Woolworths and Boots (yes Boots the Chemist) you went to the Record Department. Okay there were some National chains still like HMV but Virgin was an Independent little place, which was great for imports I seem to remember, and every town had a couple of good privately owned little record shops, some even had massive ones. The majority of these had secondhand sections too where you could dig out all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff that someone else had grown tired of. How many of you reading this (that is of course if anyone is reading this) can remember, like me, wading through the endless racks of secondhand albums in the gloriously named 'Record &amp; Tape Exchange' in Camden and Notting Hill Gate among other places filling in gaps in the beloved collection. It may have been more time consuming but it was much more fun than downloading them from the internet like people do nowadays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other thing is that in those days musicians paid their dues. They made an album every year, they played in countless bands before hitting the big time. Touring up and down the country in a beat up Bedford van. So subsequently you would find albums in the secondhand racks and be surprised by the names of musicians you knew playing in bands you'd never heard of. Because they were so cheap you bought them and thats how you got to build up a proper eclectic collection rather than 50 issues of Now Thats What I Call Music and the three albums your favourite band have released in the last 10 years that a lot of people call a collection these days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So back to 1981 then (for that is where we were about to go before i went off on that little rant !) there I am in the aforementioned Record &amp; Tape Exchange in Camden and I pick up 'Kid's Stuff' look at the musicians credits on the back and see one Bernie Marsden. Crikey thinks the seventeen year old know all that was me, thats the guitarist out of Whitesnake I'll buy that it'll probably be good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well it was good, it still is good. Whenever I play it I think of afternoons spent in the secondhand record shop when I should have been studying. The smell of the cover reminds me of the shop and of carefree happy days when the only real concern you had was where to go on Saturday night. Twenty five years from now someone who is seventeen today isn't going to be able to do that with a downloaded MP3 file, but if i'm still around I'll still have all that vinyl and the memory of finding it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This type of album wouldn't exist today, it would never have been made in the first place. The record company would have pulled the plug and no-one would have paid to make it or promote it. There were literally hundreds of great albums like this made in the seventies if you can get your hands on them. It's not brilliant, it's not revolutionary but its also not manufactured music by numbers. It is where the people involved were at the time, the ideas they had in their heads. They recorded them and put them out in the shops before they had time to tinker too much or decided they didn't think it worked. Subsequently the albums tend to be far more interesting and differ more from each other than modern day equivelants where they take three years to write an album and another year to promote it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Short shelf lives meant it was easy to experiment. That's what this album is like ........ it is like no other i have. It certainly isn't like Whitesnake and it's never bothered me one bit.
