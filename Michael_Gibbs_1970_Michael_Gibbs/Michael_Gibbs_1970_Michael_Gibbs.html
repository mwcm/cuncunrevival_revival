   "Gibbs music is full of intriguing inner detail that does not deflect from the ultimate destiny of his pieces."– BBC Music Magazine
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Mike Gibbs' ingenious arrangements suggest a pop art incarnation of a traditional big band -- assembled from blistering guitar riffage, fiery brass and deeply idiosyncratic rhythms ...[his music]...nevertheless retains the soulfulness of conventional jazz, and for all its mind-expanding consciousness, the music speaks to the body as loudly as it does the intellect. Most impressive is the tactile sumptuousness of Gibbs' sound -- the music boasts as many tints and textures as a Pantone Color Guide."– All Music Guide

   Brit-jazz composer and arranger Michael Gibbs was born in 1937 in Rhodesia. Starting in 1959, he studied in Boston at the Berklee College of Music, the Boston Conservatory , Tanglewood and the Lenox School of Music, where he studied with a who's who of contemporary jazz and modern composition: George Russell, Gunther Schuller, Iannis Xenakis, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss and others. In 1964 he moved to the UK, where he engaged himself in the rapidly emerging contemporary UK jazz scene. Starting in the late 60s and continuing into the mid 70s, he recorded a number of highly acclaimed and influential albums featuring many of the most prominent British-based jazz players who, like Michael, were beginning to flirt with jazz/rock. Since the mid 70s he has worked as a educator as well as a free-lance arranger, doing arrangements and orchestrations for major names such as Joni Mitchell, Pat Metheny, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Peter Gabriel among many others, while too infrequently recording his own music.

   Rhodesian born musician/composer Michael Gibbs moved to England in the mid 60’s and entered the world of British jazz. He must have been very persuasive – well off perhaps – because he gathered around him a sizeable ensemble of top notch musicians to record two albums for Deram that are accomplished and ambitious.

   Gibbs presents a music of complex arrangements which incorporate jazz, rock and orchestral styles - it’s easy to see why he went on to try his hand at film soundtrack. The opening piece is typical, spinning off into a series of modulations before finding its way back to some simple two chord vamp. There are similarities to Zappa’s jazz-rock of the time in both the quieter interludes, where vibes might be used, and in some heavier passages where electric guitar features, although, essentially, this is big-band jazz and would not have cut much ice with most rock fans. The music can turn nimbly from one mood to another avoiding discontinuity by relying on the large ensembles’ wide palette – cellos and flutes to electric guitar and pounding bass.... clearly Gibbs revels in the possibilities. The results can be a little indulgent but certainly not over-extended. The harmonic language is rich and the arrangements detailed. Individual performances stand out here and there but composition is paramount and Gibbs rarely resorts to small ensemble jazz for more than a brief moment before bringing in other sections of the orchestra, so the odd solo gets over-powered now and then. I get the impression that Gibbs’ approach is one of writing a score rather than allowing players to find a voice within the basic structure or hammering out a beat and layering something on top. A sleeve photograph shows him conducting the band from an elevated position with the score in front of him, but this is not a symphony orchestra and it’s a tricky business to reconcile careful arrangements and inspired improvisation whilst remaining true to jazz tradition...the very thought of it is an anathema to some and a welcome challenge to others. Gibbs pulls it off with skill and taste. But I do have a problem with some of guitarist Chris Spedding’s contributions. Listen to his entrance in the opening piece. He unwittingly destroys all forward momentum and causes it to falter, the music almost falls apart. It’s not really his fault, he’s a blues guitarist, and a fine one, but these are jazz musicians who play to a different rhythm. It’s just one example of the potential for mismatch. There’s also a tendency for the music to get bogged down in its own complexity and, although Gibbs’ large and crowded canvass is splashed with vibrant colour, it might have benefitted from some broader brush-strokes.
