     Half and Half brings Eaton's bass lines to a talented group of Funk/Fusion musicians. Original music added to covers by Aretha, the Stylistics, and War accented with solos by each member of the band is a highly recommended addition to any true fan of Funk and Fusion. Album cuts vary in tempo and temperament, but all will make a body move. Although I should limit my comments to what is there, not to what is not there, I would wish for vocals on several of the cuts. Nevertheless, that was then and this is now. Still, an important inclusion to anyone's Funk/Fusion collection.

     Half and Half makes me think "Fred Wesley";then, the flute kicks in, and I'm left wondering exactly what is going on.  Diverse?  Check.  Some strings?  Yes.  Funky ass grooves again and again until you're ready to formally bow before the human headed bull on the cover and swear allegiance to whatever pagan god spawned this bass monster?  Sure.

     Incredible jazz-funk from 1973.  Cleveland Eaton keeps the bass funky throughout as expected but the horns steal the show.  The original compositions are great, but some of the covers ("People Make the World Go Round", "Day Dreaming", "Slipping Into Darkness") could be called the definitive versions.  A must have for fans of jazz funk.

     Like the winged, part-man/part-bull creature that adorns its bizarre cover, Cleveland Eaton's Half and Half is a mutant, a jazz-funk monster that lays to waste everything in its path. Despite the structural complexity of its fusion-inspired arrangements, the record remains rooted in the driving soul-jazz grooves of Eaton's past collaborations with Ramsey Lewis, resulting in celebratory music that appeals equally to the mind and the body. Eaton also proves an imaginative composer, with originals like "Keep It Funky" and "Here Comes Funky You" fitting comfortably alongside covers including War's "Slippin' into Darkness" and the Stylistics'"Betcha by Golly, Wow." Out of print by the early 21st century, Half and Half demands a reissue worthy of its excellence.
