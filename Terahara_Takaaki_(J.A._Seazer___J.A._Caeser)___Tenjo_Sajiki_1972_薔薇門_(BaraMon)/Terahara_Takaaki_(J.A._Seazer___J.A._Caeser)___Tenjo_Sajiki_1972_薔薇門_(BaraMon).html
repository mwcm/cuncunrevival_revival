   This is a limited reissue of the ultra rare privately released Tenjo Sajiki record Baramon. This identical reissue dates from 2003 and was released in a tiny edition of 500 copies, which sold out in a matter of weeks. But about the music: 'Some of the most exciting and evocative music of the early '70s in Japan was born out of the avant-garde theatre groups that had played such a central role in the '60s ferment. One of the most important was the Tenjo Sajiki Company formed by poet, film maker, boxing fan and all-around agent provocateur Terayama Shuji. Renowned for Living-Theatre inspired audience participation happenings and extreme street theatre designed to shock the bourgeois; by 1970 the group had already become a haven for runaway teens, and a focus for police investigation. Terayama was canny enough to realize that co-opting their music was an ideal way to hijack adolescent energies and he consistently used heavy amplified rock to jump-start his chaotic, socially critical acid operas. By 1972, Baramon saw J.A. Seazer and Kuni Kawauchi (of the Happenings Four and Kirikyogen) splitting the compositional scores on a bizarre musical manifesto for sexual liberation. So far so Hair, but rather than a tribute to free love, Terayama instead composed an eloquent plea for the liberation of the sexual underclass suffering discrimination, in the form of a 'gay revolution.' It wasn't Terayama's first engagement with the Tokyo queer scene -- one of the earliest plays he wrote for the Tenjo Sajiki was a vehicle for transvestite actress and chanson singer Akihiro Miwa, who was rumored to have had a dalliance with Yukio Mishima. Baramon's opening is a blast -- a densely narrated and impassioned call to arms set to a Nazi military march that links sexual second class citizenship to imperialist social control and warmongering. Featuring the actual voices of numerous smutty, cross-dressing scene queens, the record's content was deemed so subversive that it was only sold under the counter of Tokyo gay bars. Like a biker backstage at the Cage Aux Folles, fuzzed out guitar riffs and heavy swelling organ-based psych rock tracks rub shoulders with the lachrymose ballads and tawdry, mascara smudging chanson still favored in certain Shinjuku nighteries.'" - The Wire, Alan Cummings.

   The Tenjo Sajiki Company was an avant garde theater troupe formed by Terayama Shuji &amp; was an audience participation street theatre designed to shock along the lines of the Living Theatre. Popular music was always incorporated in their projects, and so lots of rocker runaway teens were quickly attracted. By the early 70s, J.A. Ceazer and Kuni Kawauchi (of the GS group Happenings Four) had joined, and the music got really fucking weird along with the performances. Instead of just staging a version of 'Hair' like everybody else, the troupe wrote original music for a documentary about a hoped-for politically informed drag queen revolution, and of course it was also partly a musical. Drag queens (who speak &amp; sing all across the record) &amp; their nightclub chansons &amp; pop sleaze get crossed with heavy rock riffs and the result is impressively screwy. Hitler speeches, phantom organ, spare Mosrite guitar with dusted crooning, couple of goofy classical music quotes, no overly effeminate accents unless you speak pretty good Japanese though.

   Ever find yourself wondering what the gay bar scene was like in early '70s Tokyo?  Well now you've got a chance to vicariously explore that kinky time.  Baramon offers up a parade of characters - leather studs, twinks, drag queens, in-the-closet husbands, and old flames - who share stories (and occasionally songs) about Gay Revolution, the hot guys they've been with, and the hot guys they hope to get with in the near future.  Just in case the language barrier makes the plot hard to follow, the liner notes contain extensive pictures (drawings) of naked men in various states of mutual enjoyment.  The addresses and operating hours of the happening bars are also listed, just in case you're looking for some action the next time you're in town.
