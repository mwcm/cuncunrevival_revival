   Sun Ra was on the bill with Paul Bley in this July 3, 1977, solo performance at Axis-in-SoHo in New York. The material includes four Sun Ra compositions and an additional three classic numbers; St. Louis Blues, Three Little Words and Honeysuckle Rose.

   The artistic genius of Sun Ra blossoms through his piano interpretations, which capture his universal outlook of music as a vehicle to expand one's intrinsic knowledge. The canvas is vast, but Sun Ra paints each piece quite subtly so one does not dominate the others.

   A really nice live solo piano set from Ra. A few originals, a few standards, of which the originals sound like bent and twisted versions of some half-forgotten standard anyway, and the standards get bent and twisted to Ra's needs. This is maybe a little less wild overall than Monorails and Satellites though there are some really bracing moments, but there are beautiful moments in multitudes to compensate. Enjoyable for sure for Ra fans. Those less convinced of his brilliance will at least learn to accept his piano skills here, even if they're not fully converted by the end.

   The second Sun Ra solo piano sets from 1977 finds the normally forbidding keyboardist digging not only into four fairly accessible originals, but "St. Louis Blues,""Three Little Words," and "Honeysuckle Rose." By this time, Ra was starting to reinvestigate his roots in Fletcher Henderson's music and in swing, but these occasionally traditional interpretations remain full of surprises. There is definitely a charm to Sun Ra's solo piano sets.
