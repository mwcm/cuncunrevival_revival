   The first two tracks are the precursor to the flat-out chaos of Animal Collective's Here Comes the Indian and the biological noise of Black Dice. They represent an extension of Pink Floyd's "Several Species of Small Furry Animals.." (without the humor) and are as heroic as the most toxic of The Residents' apocalyptic music-halls. By being as fried as the most bacchanalic and barbaric exorcisms of rock music ever attempted, the first-side of this obscure Spanish album contaminates you with it's radiation and turns you to gurgling mush. Alas, the 22 minutes of the second-side's "3º" are much less visceral, and for the most part hark back to Pink Floyd's "Interstellar Overdrive".
