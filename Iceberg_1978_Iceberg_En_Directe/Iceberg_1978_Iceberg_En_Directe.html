   I must admit it seems strange to me to release a live album that is only 35 minutes long, but apparently they only wanted to release the live songs that weren't on any of their studio albums. So we get three long tracks.This was recorded live in Madrid and released in 1978. It doesn't measure up to the studio albums "Coses Nostres" or "Sentiments" but there's enough here to warrrant a low 4 star rating in my opinion.The guitar and keyboards are the focus as usual with this band and they certainly do not disappoint on this one.The album cover appeals to me as well.

   "Oh ! Un Anec Simfonic Ones" is the almost 18 minute opener.The home crowd can be heard cheering wildly as the album starts. It then turns quiet as the guitar comes in followed by bass, drums then synths.This actually reminds me of BRAND X here. A calm after 2 1/2 minutes as the piano leads.You can hear the crowd cheering in the background.The sound builds and this does sound pretty amazing. Love the guitar. Another calm with synths before 7 1/2 minutes as the crowd noise becomes evident once again. It builds and we get some ripping guitar 8 1/2 minutes in then it's like the song ends but then they start up again with a different melody before 10 1/2 minutes.This is more laid back.It settles more 12 minutes in then the guitar starts to light it up 13 1/2 minutes in. It settles back again 15 1/2 minutes in.Great tune !

   "Canco Per Qualsevol Orquestra" has a bit of a funky rhythm to it. Piano before 2 minutes then the guitar leads. Piano is back as they take turns leading.

   "Histories" is the almost 11 minute closer.This actually reminds me most of what I like about this band. Cheering to start then atmosphere with piano to for about a minute, then the guitar and drums kick in hard. Great sound here. Synths to the fore at 4 minutes.The guitar is back after 5 1/2 minutes and he proceeds to rip it up. A calm after 8 minutes with atmosphere then it kicks back in again. It ends before 10 minutes but then they return for a short piece that seems to end abruptly.

   Just simply some killer playing on this one and it's cool to hear these new tracks as well.
