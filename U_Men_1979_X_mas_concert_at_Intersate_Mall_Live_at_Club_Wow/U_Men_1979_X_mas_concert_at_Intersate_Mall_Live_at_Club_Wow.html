  A semi-approved bootleg limited to 500 copies. Original covers were promo jackets of Patti Smith's Horses album pasted over with printed pieces of paper front and back. Probably recorded in 1978 and mostly at Pirate's Cove in Cleveland. "I Will Wait" was recorded at the Homestead Theater. No other details are remembered. Released on Tri-City Records in 1979. The label on Side 1 reads "X-Mas Concert At Interstate Mall." The label on Side 2 reads "Live At Club Wow." (For the record, there was no such place as Interstate Mall, or Club Wow, for that matter.)

  This same bootleg was re-booted, unofficially, as Don't Expect Art (Impossible Recordworks IMP1-07) in 1980. "Don't Expect Art" was an Ubu Communex injunction of the day so the source of the re-boot was probably also a fan.
