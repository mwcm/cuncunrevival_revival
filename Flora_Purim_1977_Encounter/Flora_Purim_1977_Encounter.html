   This was one of Flora Purim's finest all-around jazz recordings, and it is luckily available on CD. Purim is featured in a variety of challenging and stimulating settings: on two numbers ("Above the Rainbow" and "Tomara") with pianist McCoy Tyner; teamed up with tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson on Chick Corea's "Windows" and "Black Narcissus"; and utilizing such players as bass trombonist Raul DeSouza, keyboardists Hermeto Pascoal and George Duke, and singer Urszula Dudziak (who is heard on "Encounter") plus Flora's husband, percussionist Airto. The music is primarily group originals and finds Flora Purim in peak form. Highly recommended.

   Encounters opens with Windows, a Chick Corea composition. The band is so great with George Duke on keyboards, Joe Henderson on tenor sax, Airto on percussion and Ndugu on drums. Flora glides above with her exquisite vocalizations and wordless textures. Hermeto Pascoal joins Flora on many of these selections adding keyboards, though I miss his bamboo flute and other talents on this album. Dedicated to Bruce is an excellent collaboration between Pascoal and Purim with some fine trombone soloing by Raul De Souza. There is a fantastic scat section in the middle where Flora showcases her incredible vocal range and dexterity. McCoy Tyner plays acoustic piano on Above The Rainbow and Ron Carter plays upright bass on a few tracks as well. Black Narcissus, a Joe Henderson composition is a very nice duo of vocal and sax. Its a tight collection of musicians, performing great compositions, while being recorded flawlessly.

   This is truly one of those records that I had forgotten just how great it really is. Rather than being progressive jazz for the sake of soloing, this seems to be a bit more true to the songs.

   The cover is an almost madonna-like (not that Madonna) photo of Flora looking very peaceful and content. Statuesque. Acrobatic like an olympic athlete preparing to fly.

   In the mid-1970s, Flora Purim became the Queen of Fusion Jazz. She, along with Urszula Dudziak, were the major jazz vocalists to embrace new sounds and ways of thinking. Flora's albums "Open Your Eyes You Can Fly" and "That's What She Said" showed that creative vocals had a place within the mostly instrumental genre of fusion. Recorded and released between those two fusion masterpieces in 1976, however, is "Encounter", which was a very mellow, very jazzy album that isn't going to excite too many fusion-heads.

   Despite that, the quality of this album is undeniable, and represents a big leap from her earlier straight-jazz leanings on 1973's "Butterfly Dreams." All of the pieces on offer are well-played, well thought-out, and beautifully sung. The roster of musicians includes first-rate guys like Joe Henderson and McCoy Tyner, as well as dueling vocals with Urszula Dudziak and Googie Coppola on the title track. In fact, the two pieces featuring Tyner (including a duet) are some of the most unusual work that either McCoy or Flora have done. And Henderson's solos are just as lush and wonderful as always--did that guy have tone, or what?

   The highlight of the album, for me, is a version of Henderson's "Black Narcissus" that I rate considerably higher than the original version on Joe's "Power to the People" album. Flora's take on "Black Narcissus" puts so much into what is already a wonderful composition. Joe himself even puts in a good solo. You should buy the album for this track alone.

   I find this to be a great chill-out album when I need to decompress. It doesn't get the blood pumping, but it adds something worthwhile to my life, and what more could one ask?
