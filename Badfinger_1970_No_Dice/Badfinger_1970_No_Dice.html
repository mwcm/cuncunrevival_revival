   No Dice was Badfinger's first masterpiece ( and my first Badfinger album!). Paul McCartney's positive influence on the bands sound on Magic Christian Music has been developed further on this album. The inspiration from The Beatles can be heard on most of these songs, but this album shows that they're much more than just a Beatles rip off. Some changes had been made since the recording of Magic Christian Music. Geoff Emerick (known from his work with The Beatles) produced most of the album; the rest of it was produced by Mal Evans who also produced some of Magic Christian Music. Ron Griffiths had already left before the release of the previous album so Tom Evans had now taken over the bass. Joey Molland ,who had played with Gary Walker, was chosen for a new guitarist. The material (the songs) on this album is very strong. Without You written by Tom and Pete has become an alltime classic - heres the original version - superior to any version I've heard so far. Enjoy Pete's organ line at the end of the song - sounds like something Matthew Fisher of Procol Harum could have done. No Matter What, Midnight Caller and We're For The Dark all show what a brilliant songwriter with an unique sense of melody Pete Ham had already become. The album is a perfect blend of ballads, rockers and a bit of country (Blodwyn), generally performed with more rocking feeling than their earlier recordings. Though the album is obviously dominated by Pete Ham's songs all other members contribute to it. The bonus-tracks are all very good - 4 of them hail from the never-released follow-up album to No Dice recorded early 1971. The strongest of them is the group-composition I'll Be The One, which at a certain point was considered as a single - I believe it had the hit-single potential. Another bonus-track is Joey's Mean, Mean Jemina rerecorded for his After The Pearl album; this version is much better.
