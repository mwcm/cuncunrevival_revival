   Released on the Hendrix Estate's own Dagger Records, this mono recording was captureed by a fan at the Oakland Coliseum on April 27, 1969. Noted for Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady sitting in and including the longest recorded version of Voodoo Child (Slight Return) clocking at over 18 minutes.

   Spread over two discs, The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Live In Oakland presents the group’s April 27, 1969 concert at the Oakland Coliseum. The Experience’s spirited Oakland performance was capped off with an eighteen minute, extended jam of “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)”. Joining the group onstage for this final number was Jefferson Airplane bassist [and Electric Ladyland contributor] Jack Casady.

   The concert was recorded by Ken Koga using a single microphone onto a portable Sony reel to reel deck. The concert was not professionally recorded, so Ken’s amatuer tapes represent the only known documentation of this inspired performance. The monophonic sound is unobtrusive and clear, but far from industry [as well as Jimi’s own] standards.

   Fans of the Experience will recognize the set list, as songs such as “Fire”, “Purple Haze”, and “Spanish Castle Magic” were staples of the 1969 US tour repertoire, but there are many intriguing elements marbled throughout the eighty-five minute performance. Highlights include Jimi’s spontaneous reworking of “Hey Joe”, complete with passages about the `soldiers in Vietnam’. Jimi’s two blues workouts, “Red House” and “Hear My Train A Comin'” are particularly strong, as is a raucous, extended rendition of “Foxey Lady”. The evening came to a close with a rousing finale, as Casady climbed onstage to join the group for “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)”.

   In 1998, the first release of Dagger Records saw the light in the form of the marketing of this Oakland Concert (April 27, 1969). Dagger label puts boot recordings on the market and label them as official. Here is the definition of what Dagger Records intended to be (taken from the official Hendrix site):
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   ''To service Jimi's fans, we have created Dagger Records, a unique label established to release bootleg' recordings which further detail Jimi's illustrious legacy''. And you should expect no less, no more.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   Since this concert only took place some four months before Woodstock, the track list is very similar (but shorter here). The sound was captured in the audience (mono format.) The first three tracks aren't quite well recorded I must say. Still, from ''Here My Train?'' onwards, it is of decent quality and better than lots of other boots even if this raw music might be a bit too much at times (the second part of ''Spanish Castle Magic'' for instance).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   At the time of recording, ''Hear My Train?'' is still called ''Get My Heart Back Together Again'' (one can hear this during the song intro). This version is maybe the best I've heard: the middle solo section is just phenomenal. But experiencing Hendrix live is always a pleasure to me.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   From this track onwards, the best of Hendrix' repertoire is played. Some of them will be extensively stretched: ''Foxy Lady'' (over 10 minutes) and of course the longest taped version of ''Voodoo Child'' which clocks at over eighteen minutes (almost five minutes longer than the Woodstock magical version).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This boot recording is supervised by the Hendrix LLC which is supposed to be ''cleaner'' than previous producers. To my understanding, under the virtuous stamp of willing to restore Jimi's music honourably, it is just another cash machine. His half-sister (Janie Hendrix) was even accused for having earned unbelievable salaries from the company. She answered: ''I've worked hard''?This boot is available for 20$ on their official site. OK, it's a double CD set since the performance lasted for about ? 84 minutes! See what I mean?.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This collection of live performances (10 so far under the Dagger Records umbrella) is of course a benediction for Hendrix addicts (as I am) but the casual fan will perfectly live with the Woodstock set or other official releases which are better recorded and much more symbolic than this particular one. Even if ''Hear My Train'' and ''Foxy Lady'' are damned impressive.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The version of ''Star Spangled Banner'' is a great preview to the ultimate Woodstock one. Pretty close a version actually which will also fades in ''Purple Haze''. I told you, this set is (partially) very similar. The long jam during ''Voodoo'' is of course a delectation for Hendrix fans (but for them only). It could have last forever apparently since after the band presentation (around minute 14) the band is still jamming.
