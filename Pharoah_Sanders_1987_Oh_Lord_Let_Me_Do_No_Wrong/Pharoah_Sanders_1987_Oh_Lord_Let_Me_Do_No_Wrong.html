   Pharoah Sanders is no doubt a musician who has had a rough time escaping his own legacy. Known for pushing John Coltrane to his most "out" heights and for free/spiritual jazz blowouts of stunning power and ferociousness ("Karma"), Sanders settled down a bit as he got older. Not in terms of his playing, he maintained a fire and energy to that, but in his music. His forms settled down and he began exploring ballads, standards, and the like. The result of this has been a mixture of brilliance and frustration. It seems at times as though Sanders isn't really feeling what he's playing.

   Thankfully, his late '80s reunion with vocalist Leon Thomas, who sung on so many of Sanders' early great records, "Oh Lord, Let Me Do No Wrong", is not one of these albums. Sanders is in a sympathetic light, with his backing band supportive and expressive (particularly pianist William S. Henderson III). And Sanders is totally on fire, particularly on the cuts Thomas joins the band-- the reggae-ish title track (where the vocalist and the saxophonist push each other), goofy blues "If It Wasn't For a Woman", and blues standard "Next Time You See". Sanders comes roaring in ways he hadn't in decades upon Thomas' declaration-- "tell 'em about it, Pharoah!". Fierce and explosive, full of fire and nearly unhinged, its something to behold.

   Likewise, Sanders seems to find both COltranes "Equinox" and the two standards he picked up ("Polka Dots and Moonbeans" and "Clear Out of This World") particularly inspiring, whether he's full of fire or balladry. He certainly is on a tear on Trane's theme.

   Admittedly it's not quite "Karma" or any of those records, but it's certainly a good record. Highly recommended.
