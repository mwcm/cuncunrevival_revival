   As a junior high school student without a father, I live with my mother in a village at the foot of Mount Osore . The only pleasure was to have Itako call the father's spirit and talk. Next to my house is a young married woman, married from another place , who is the person I want. One day, when I went to the circus that came to the village, I was told by the members about the outside world, and I began to yearn for it. I was disgusted with my current life, so I decided to go home and promised to leave the village with my next married woman, who also hated living. Two people meet at the station and walk on the track ...

   So far, it's part of an autobiographical film I've produced as a director . The people who came to the preview praised me for the movie and praised me. Then I went into the snack with the critics and said , `` If you go back hundreds of years on a time machine and kill your old three-year-old grandmother, do you think you will be gone now? "Was asked. I pondered the meaning of the question and met myself as a boy. As a boy, I state that the boyhood depicted in the film was adapted and not true. And what is true boyhood like?

   The villagers were all crazy, and the circus was actually a group of perverts . From the married woman I was told that was not to seriously plan of running away from home, and the man of the mistress in front of suicide would be. Meanwhile, the boy came across me today. I, now, came in the past to find out what would happen if I killed my mother. As they talk, the boy decides to leave his mother and move to Tokyo. However, as she prepares for departure, her virgin is robbed by a woman returning from Tokyo. The dying boy got on the train and left home. After all, the mother killing did not occur. I waited for the boy, but nothing changed.

   My favourite Caesar album. A mixture of elegance and suspense keeps the listener on her/his toes for most of the album. Like all of Caesar's albums (at least those I've heard thus far) the music is woven out of a soundtrack fabric, and is filled with spoken word parts and extensive façade-like movements which may try a listeners' patience, but all in all the album is very rewarding and warmly recommended.
