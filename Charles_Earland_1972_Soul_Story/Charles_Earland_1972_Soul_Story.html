   Charles Earland and his band of players including Houston Person and Maynard Parker jump start things with the rousing funk-jazz of Betty’s Dilemma with some pounding drums by Jesse Kilpatrick who lets loose with a long LOOOOONG drum break as well. Earland changes pace with the next song, Love Story with its moody beginning before going into a little vamp, probably the only version of this song I’ve ever actually liked. On the second side Earland returns to his more traditional, swinging soul-jazz with One For Scotty. The band also does a decent cover of S. Wonder’s I Was Made To Love Her. Probably one of Earland’s best albums.

   This has never made a reissue on lp but I seem to remember a couple of tracks from it have made compilation albums.
