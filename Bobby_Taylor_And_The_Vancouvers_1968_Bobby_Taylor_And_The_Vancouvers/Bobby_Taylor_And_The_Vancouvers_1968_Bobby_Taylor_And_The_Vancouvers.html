   Taylor was a Washington, D.C. native and childhood friend of Marvin Gaye who relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, for his music career. At the behest of Supremes Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard, Taylor and his group were signed to Motown, where, assigned to the Gordy imprint—and produced by Berry Gordy himself—they had a hit out of the box. Taylor was a talent scout himself: at Motown he discovered the Jackson 5 and produced most of their first album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Although the Jacksons and Motown credited Diana Ross with discovering The Jackson 5, Taylor was the person who found the band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor fronted the band Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers. At a 1968 concert in Chicago, a family group called The Jackson 5 were their opening act. Impressed by the group, Taylor arranged for The Jackson 5 to audition for Berry Gordy and other executives at Motown. The group was signed to Motown, and Taylor would become their first producer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In a 2011 interview for the documentary "Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon," Taylor talked about first seeing The Jackson 5. "I saw this little kid spinning and stuff and said, ‘Dang, send him upstairs. When he finishes, I want to talk to this kid.'"
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He produced The Jackson 5's early Motown songs including a version of Smokey Robinson's "Who's Lovin' You." Gordy felt the songs produced by Taylor were old-fashioned, and he would assign a new producer for the young group.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor was born Feb. 18, 1934, in Washington, D.C. He sang in doo-wop groups in New York City. He moved out west and was in a band called Little Daddy and the Bachelors. One of the band members was Tommy Chong, who would go on to greater fame as a comedian and one-half of the duo Cheech and Chong.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The group's members ended up changing the band's name to Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers. The band was signed to Motown in 1965 on the recommendation of Supremes members Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. The band had a top-five R&amp;B song, "Does Your Mama Know About Me," in 1968.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Bobby had a range that exceeded even Patti LaBelle," Chong told Rolling Stone.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor went on to have a solo career for Motown. He later moved to China and then to Hong Kong, performing in clubs there. His last-known recording was on a tribute song for the late, legendary rock guitarist Dick Wagner.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Bobby Taylor &amp; The Vancouvers from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, had their best years with the Motown subsidiary Gordy in the late 1960s, scoring three hit singles in 1968. The first turned out to be their best with Does Your Mama Know About Me? reaching # 4 R&amp;B/# 29 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May b/w Fading Away. Later that fall I Am Your Man struggled to a # 40 R&amp;B/# 85 Hot 100 b/w If You Love Her, and in December Malinda peaked at # 16 R&amp;B/# 48 Hot 100 b/w It's Growing.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The sextet - consisting of Taylor on vocals, Robbie King on keyboard, Wes Henderson on bass, Ted Lewis on drums, and Edward Patterson and Tommy Chong [who would later team up with Richard Marin to form the comedy due Cheech &amp; Chong] on guitar - was a racially mixed group whose fame, unlike most Motown congregations, was short-lived.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1975 Taylor, who would also be credited with discovering The Jackson 5, had a minor solo hit with Why Play Games [# 83 R&amp;B b/w Don't Wonder Why] for the Playboy label. but neither is included here. What is nice about this CD is that it gives you all six sides of their three Gordy hits, although I doubt if too many will be ordering one at the used price indicated.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Why not re-release with a couple of added tracks, i.e., the Taylor solo sides. That way, those having copies of the original release can continue to regard it as a collector's item.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A San Francisco nightclub launched one of the most exciting bands to come out the Northwest. Tommy Chong and Bobby Taylor formed Four N*ggers &amp; a Ch*nk from Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors, who originated from the Shades, a Calgary/Edmonton-based group. Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors recorded a couple singles, including "Too Much Monkey Business" out of Vancouver, British Columbia.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The offensive name killed the fan base that Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors had built. It's unclear whether Bobby Taylor was a member of the Bachelors -- Tommy Milton, Donald Mallory, Chong, and Wes Henderson -- but he was with the latter group who changed their name weekly around the same theme: Four Coloured Fellas and a Chinese Lad...Four N's and a C, before settling on Bobby Taylor &amp; the Vancouvers. The original Vancouvers, in addition to Chong and Taylor, were Wes Henderson (guitar), Robbie King (keyboards), Ted Lewis (drums), and Eddie Patterson (bass).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   They rebuilt their fan base by doing spirited, rockish versions of Motown hits. Jimi Hendrix played with them at one point for a year (prior to his stint with the Isley Brothers), mainly at Seattle's Black and Tan Club, but was fired because his solos were too long and loud. Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard heard the band when they played at Chong and Taylor's after-hours joint, the Elegant Parlor in Vancouver; Berry Gordy was contacted and the group signed with the hot recording company. It turned out to be a horrible mistake, but if they hadn't, would they have ever emerged from the Northwest?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor was a veteran when he inked with Motown in 1967, he was born February 18, 1934, making him 33 at the time of the signing. In Washington, D.C., he grew up in a public housing project and sang doo wops with friends on the street corners, sometimes joined by a tall, skinny kid named Marvin Gaye. Taylor's father was a full-blooded Native American and his grandfather, who had a singing group, was Puerto Rican. The Taylors knew all the musicians and their home was used as a resting place and motel for many artists who came through the district.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor and friends traveled to Brooklyn, New York -- the Fort Green Projects -- to doo wop with locals who became Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials and Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, but nothing happened until he migrated west and connected with Chong.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Motown got Bobby &amp; the Vancouvers' name out there, but things were never right. They suffered the same indignation as the Isley Brothers and were viewed as carpetbagging, newcomers, and were ignored, by Taylor's account, by "90 percent of the artists." And to add salt to an open wound: Johnny Bristol didn't like Tommy Chong, who was married with a kid and a die-hard pot smoker. Taylor left the group sometime after the first album, which contained their hit "Does Your Mama Know About Me" (number 29, 1968), and two lesser smoothies: "Malinda" and "I Am Your Man." The Vancouvers were reduced to backing blue-eye soul singer Chris Clark on gigs. A Canadian, Chong needed green cards for himself and the bass player and was fired by Clark (actually Bristol) when he left in the middle of a gig for a green card interview.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Taylor "discovered" the Jackson 5, who were billed with him for a ten-day stint at Chicago's Regal Theater. He took them back to Detroit and put them up in his apartment while he prepped them for an audition with Motown. He was living in a mostly lily-white apartment building at the time, and when management saw all the little black kids running around, they kicked Taylor and the Jacksons out.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Motown released his solo album, Taylor Made Soul, on Gordy; a good album that met with disinterest. Some of its titles, however ("I've Been Blessed,""Don't Be Afraid,""Out in the Country," and "Eleanor Rigby"), were bona fide. A second album was reportedly recorded but never issued.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Jacksons passed their audition with distinction and Taylor was busy flying to Los Angeles to record them. His productions with the J5, except for some tracks that appeared on their debut album, were shelved for years. Taylor cut mostly old soul tunes with them to demonstrate their singing skills. But Berry Gordy wanted a contemporary sound that would cross over to all segments, so he created the Corporation with Deke Richards, Fonce Mizelle, Freddie Perren, Taylor, and himself. Taylor worked on the first three Jackson 5 hits, but got no credit. He was out by 1970; according to many, Taylor was a bear to get along with. The Jackson 5 situation caused IRS problems for Taylor and he subsequently sued Motown for unpaid royalties, won the suit, but supposedly never got paid.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tommy Chong hooked up with Cheech Marin and the two became comedians and actors who glorified marijuana use. The rest of the Vancouvers continued in bands and worked day jobs. After Motown, Taylor recorded for Epic, Playboy, and Philadelphia International Records (never issued); none were as successful as his Motown releases.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He developed throat cancer and relocated to Columbus, Ohio, where he lived with his mother for years before returning west and settling in the San Jose, California area. He was part of Ian Levine's near 900-track Motorcity project, cutting one of the Britisher's best songs and tracks -- "Cloudy Day," a stupendous ballad. He formed Bobby Taylor &amp; the New Vancouvers and reportedly performed occasional gigs in the San Jose area. Later, Taylor moved to Hong Kong, where he set up a production company and also performed. He died in Hong Kong in July of 2017.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Little Daddy &amp; the Bachelors tracks -- featuring Tommy Chong's rock guitar licks -- can be heard on Northwest Killers, Vol. 2: Shout (1964-1965), which includes "Come on Home," and Real Gone Aragon, Vol. 1, which features "Junior's Jerk" and "Too Much Monkey Business." Another track, "Valley of Tears," has been compiled elsewhere.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A marvelous but underrated collection by Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, one of the few mixed groups to record for Motown. Tommy Chong, later of Cheech &amp; Chong fame, was a member and co-wrote their biggest record, "Does Your Mama Know About Me," a song about an interracial relationship. Though their biggest hit was a ballad, they built their reputation by singing spirited live versions of Motown and soul classics. Bobby's tenor dripped with soul, as his crooning on Ashford &amp; Simpson's "I Am Your Man" attests. "Malinda," one of Smokey Robinson's catchiest songs, will have you singing along with the chorus. A good version of the Temptations'"Fading Away" and the Fantastic Four's "You Gave Me Something" will have you finger-snapping and hand-clapping.
