   Live at Newport was the first live recording McCoy Tyner led, and it happened to be among his most memorable dates for Impulse, but like many memorable sessions, it was the end result of equal parts planning, spontaneity, and talent. According to Willis Conover's original liner notes, Tyner was worn out from playing Montreal the night before, and he was paired with three musicians he'd never played with before (trumpeter Clark Terry, alto saxophonist Charlie Mariano, and bassist Bob Cranshaw), two of who were using borrowed instruments. Given such chaotic circumstances, it's not surprising that the quintet (also featuring drummer Mickey Roker, a former colleague of Tyner's) chose to play two standards, plus Tyner's "Monk's Blues," Dizzy Gillespie's "Woody 'n' You," and the improvised opening jam, "Newport Romp." What is a surprise is that not only does the group hold together, but they excel. They sound empathetic, as if they've played many times before, yet there are enough sparks to signal that they're still unsure of what the other will play. The results are thoroughly compelling and unpredictable, even when it's just a Tyner showcase, like "Monk's Blues." Essentially a solo showcase with support from Cranshaw and Roker, Tyner really pushes on this number, beginning it as a Monk homage and pushing it to continually inventive territory. It's the riskiest playing on the record from Tyner, but just because Live at Newport isn't as risky as his work with Coltrane during the early '60s doesn't mean it's limp or complacent. It's straight-ahead hard bop in the best possible sense -- accessible but stimulating, engaging and vibrant from beginning to end.

   Newcomers and casual jazz fans will associate McCoy Tyner only with John Coltrane's classic 1960's quartet, but his discography is full of some phenomenal albums he made as a leader throughout the 1960's and 1970's. Live At Newport is no exception, it's a stimulating performance with Tyner and company firing on all cylinders at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1963. Three of the tracks are performed by a quintet (with Clark Terry and the now obscure Charlie Mariano on the brass) and two feature just the trio of Tyner, Bob Cranshaw and Mickey Roker.

   The quintet tracks are pure hard bop nirvana, with tons of energy and a driving rhythm section led by Tyner's outsize talents. The liner notes tell us that Tyner was not only nearly too exhausted to play the afternoon set (having played Montreal till the wee hours the night before), but the group put together by Bob Thiele had two guys (Mariano and Cranshaw) that Tyner had never played with before. The bluesy opening number "Newport Romp" (listen above) is worth the price of admission alone, and is all the more impressive given the fact that the quintet made it up on the spot. The trio performances are upbeat and excellent, with lots of symbiotic playing between the three players, and let's us hear Tyner in a setting that he's not necessarily known for, but one that he excels at.

   McCoy Tyner was a busy man when this album was recorded in 1963. Earlier that year in March he would record John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (Impulse! A-40) and just a month before Live At Newport he was at Rudy Van Gelder's studio to play on Joe Henderson's ultra-classic Page One (Blue Note BLP 4140). To end out the year, in October and November, Tyner would take part in yet another classic album in the form of Coltrane's Live At Birdland. That he had the energy and drive to excel on these sessions and lead his own is a testament to the creativity that was obviously oozing from his fingertips. While many jazz players hope to record one recording with some lasting power, Tyner managed to play on four in the course of one year. Amazing.
