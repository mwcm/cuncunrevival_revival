  Groove The Funk’ is an essential and influential early Afro-funk LP. The album was originally released in 1975 by the Clover Recording Organization from Aba, Nigeria. The music is top notch Afrobeat mixed with amazing funk-psych grooves, featuring lots of fuzz guitar and bad-ass keyboard playing. This album certainly is a fine exponent of the Nigerian scene! ….

  The mighty Aktion dropped “Groove The Funk” in 1975, laying down the foundations for the wealth of Afro-funk which followed. Driven ecstatically through the heart of the dance by the incredible rhythms of master percussionist Ben Alaka, “Groove The Funk” is alive with fuzz guitar and searing organ, laying waste to its imitators with the full force of psychedelic funk. The group, also known as The Action 13 or The Actions were founded in Warri and quickly took the country by storm with a string of incendiary live performances at college campuses and the infamous Lido Night Club, going on to release their debut LP on Clover Recording Organization, home to (Super)Wings, Akwassa, Mary Afi Usuah, Folk 77, The Apostles and Mansion. An exciting introduction to one of the most explosive African scenes of the 70s, “Groove the Funk” is fuses the finest Afrobeat with amazing funky-psych grooves. If you love your fuzz guitar and bad-ass keyboard playing, then this is the one for you. ……
