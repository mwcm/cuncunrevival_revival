   I mean, just look at all the musicians involved here... in 1977 these were the most admired and in-demand jazz/rock musicians around, and many of them are STILL top draw, even after almost 30 years!  Names like George Duke (who is all OVER this album), Byron Miller (bass), Jay Graydon (guitar), Raul de Souza (trombone), Ernie Watts (horns), Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, and of course her husband and lifelong best friend Airto Moriera.

   Granted, by 1977 jazz fusion was in the waning years of its greatest popularity, but that didn't stop Flora from assembling an all-star cast and recording the album of her life.  I like just about everything she does-- her music is timeless and filled with emotion, and the way she combines her Brazilian heritage with rock and jazz is sublime.  In the very early years (1970 with Chick Corea's Return to Forever and her early 70s solo albums), Flora used her voice as much as an instrument to create experimental sounds and effects as she did for singing straight lyrical parts.  She and Ursula Dudek (wife of Polish violinist extraordinaire Michal Urbaniak) seem to have the corner on the market of female jazz vocalists who dared to defy sound/style categorization.  Maricia Platon, who sang on Zao's first album Z=7L, is another one who used her voice like an electronic keyboard, scatting, doo-wooping, eeeeoooowwwwwing, etc when there was room for improv.  These ladies were bold!

   The track "Angels" even turned out to be an FM "hit" in '77, cuz I remember hearing it on FM radio back then (although it wasn't as big as Fleetwood Mac, but then who was?).  This album is packed with badass jazz/rock jamming too, because NONE of these guest artists end up short-changed during their appearances, especially Duke, who quite possibly presents his most manic and possed synth flurries and keyboard textures on ANY of the recordings he's been a part of (which is ALOT).

   There are your lovely ballad-type love songs (Bridges), your get on your feet and DANCE funk tunes (Fairy Tale Friend), dreamy cosmic jazz fusion chill tunes (You Love Me Only), and your full-flight leaving-the-galaxy-NOW jamming fusion blasters in the title track (sub-titled "Nada Sera Como Antes"... Brazilian anyone?).  Yep, this baby has it all, and up till just recently it was only available on CD in Japan for some ridiculous price I could have my car painted with.  But I'm lucky to have friends who DIDN'T get rid of all their vinyl when the CD craze first hit back in the 80s... I'm such a dummy! (Isn't "dummy" a nice word?  I could have said shit-head, but why be harsh just because everyone else is?)

   So, for those of you who love hardcore jazz fusion with a little Brazilian spice and lotsa badass funk with your love-stuff, this is the album to get.  Angels alone will have you humming the tune for days!

   This is Purim's first album for Warner Bros. after spending 1973-1976 with Milestone. While Purim's last dates with Milestone began to reflect a more commercial jazz sound, the style came to fruition by the time of this 1977 album. Drummer Leon "Ndugu" Chancler is listed as producer, and George Duke is also here, under his alias of Dawili Gonga. Given that fact, this effort sounds like a Duke production job, and like one of his late-'70s classic albums. Patrice Rushen's meditative "You Love Me Only" strikes the delicate balance between Purim's singular phrasing and persona and more streamlined production values. Earth Wind and Fire members Al McKay and Phillip Bailey contribute "Angels," and it has the sound of period EWF juxtaposed to Purim's patented and sensual wordless vocalizations. Although the artist adapts to each style, Nothing Will Be As It Was...Tommorow also has her covering the work of Brazilian artist Milton Nascimento, who co-wrote the title. Nascimento's whimsical "Fairy Tale Friend" gets a funkier treatment, as the song's lyrics lose nothing in translation. The album's most poignant track from Nascimento, "Bridges," has a doleful arrangement and a gentle vocal from Purim. Although this effort seemed to get lost in the shuffle, it is well worth seeking out, especially for lovers of late-'70s jazz fusion.
