   This is not just another Chet Baker album. These two CDs contain, for the first time in one set, all the recordings he made with his quintetthe crewunder Dick Bocks direction at the Los Angeles Forum Theatre in July 1956. On these sessions Chet plays throughout with even greater warmth, virility and maturity of conception than on previous recordings, but with the lyricism that was his forte intact. Ursos earthy, strongly swinging tenor, out of the brothers school, also raises the ante. In the rhythm section Bobby Timmons, who adds a powerful solo voice on piano, is buoyantly funky, while Jimmy Bond and Peter Littman complete a grooving, effectively driving unit behind the soloists.

   I own over 100 Chet Baker CD's, and this CD never gets old, and it is great fun to listen to. Some of the songs on this CD are some of my favorite Chet Baker songs. I would rate "Extra Mild" and "Night on Bop Mountain" as two of my all time favorite top 5-10 Chet Baker tunes. If you are a Chet Baker fan and haven't heard these two, you have no idea of what you are missing. "Night on Bop Mountain" is a take-off on Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain," a tune where Bill Loughbrough, who happened to leave a review above, takes center stage. The composer is not listed, although Bill Loughbrough is known to have written or co-written many of the original tunes on the album. I have listened to "Extra Mild" 10 times in a row, and never tire of that really cool and catchy tune, nor have I ever tired of this CD, and is one of my most played Chet Baker CD's.
