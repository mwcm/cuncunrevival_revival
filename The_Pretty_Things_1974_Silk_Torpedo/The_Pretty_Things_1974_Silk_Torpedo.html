  The Pretty Things in the early 70s are an odd band to get your head around. If you look at photos of them from this period they look like a mean bunch of bastards who would pummel you with pure rock and roll fifth such is the glorious nature of their luxurious hair. And when you consider their history you find a lunatic ex-drummer who'd put Keith Moon's antics to shame, the court appearances for all kinds of debauched and criminal behaviour, the blazing early R'n'B material and the rock opera album that clearly showed a band who ingested more acid than was good for them. So cut to the early 1970s, when there was some serious hard rock competition out there, you'd expect the Pretty Things to be serious contenders, right?
  <br/>

  Wrong. Their first post S.F. Sorrow album was the at times soft rock Parachute and though there are a couple of moments that threaten to get nasty, it's a surprisingly "pleasant" album. Luckily though, the album still saw the band experimenting and so there are a ton of neat little production tricks and little mini suites of songs, and for a 1970's "back to basics" album it's one of the most adventurous out there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1972's Freeway Madness continues the feel of Parachute, only with less experimentation. Sure the album kicks off with the epic Love Is Good and there are still a couple shorter Parachute-style songs in Peter and Allnight Sailor, but by and large this is fairly safe, commercial rock. The nearest it comes to letting rip with some rock and roll mayhem is with Havana Bound which allows Phil May to wail like his pants are too tight, but even here it's still essentially a commercial pop song dressed up as a rock song. Onion Soup also comes close, but it's marred by an odd mix with the guitars too low in the mix so although it has a riff that threatens to kick your arse it never really gets close to doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What's left is a slick collection of inoffensive rock songs plus an obligatory country number in the cunningly titled Country Road, all of which sounds like the logical follow-up to Parachute, albeit a slightly inferior follow-up. What it doesn't sound like is that it's the work of the same band that put out Midnight to Six Man, Come See Me or S.F. Sorrow but then really it's not given the line-up changes that they went through. And in light of those line-up changes this wouldn't necessarily be something to recommend to fans of the earlier sound because it is so different and only distantly related. For anyone who made the post S.F. Sorrow plunge with Parachute then this would be a logical step to make but make no mistake: it doesn't match the quality of Parachute and lacks much of the experimentation of that album, and though this too often plays it safe, it holds up well as a solid, if unremarkable early 70s rock album.

  Silk Torpedo provides an interesting glance into the glam era. Beginning with "Dream" -- a ghostly instrumental prelude that the group's friends in Led Zeppelin would later cop for "In the Evening" -- this album launches into "Joey," a superb combination of piano boogie, crashing drums, and melodramatic choruses draped in Hammond organ. Phil May's vocals on this piece run somewhere between Ian Hunter and Steve Tyler, and are every bit as effective. "Maybe You Tried" is a glittering slice of glam rock, all pouting and hip-thrusting, with a simply killer guitar hook from Pete Tolson. From this strong start, though, the album falters into a torpid sort of introspection. Still, "Belfast Cowboys" deserves kudos for taking on the Irish question long before U2 was taking its first music lessons. The CD reissue adds live versions of "Singapore Silk Torpedo" and "Dream/Joey," both recorded in 1974.
