  One of the things so exciting &amp; precious about these guys is their commitment to doing battle in the outer-limits, as in do-or-die, foot through the floor fulgurous-ferocity. There’s just no fucking around, they ALWAYS deliver, &amp; their over-spilling magnanimity &amp; direct &amp; staunchly substantial application renders that charred, direct-hit satisfaction. More than anything actually, the most consecutive, tremulous &amp; assaulting component is Takeo, who only seems to be interested in “going for guts” &amp; enforcing his speed-fixated, mesomorphic fanaticism &amp; budo enhanced (surely?) power, consistently collapsing the foundries &amp; throwing their severed pieces in a million directions. His power, stamina &amp; fury are legendary phenomenology, but also his punctilious &amp; tight playing, with clean &amp; vicious rolls galore shredding adversaries &amp; obstacles. The guy even looks the part, like notorious 1960’s psycho lone gangster actor Bunko Sugiwara, aviators, Buddhist crop, flaccid fag lolling out his chops á-la tepodama-hoodlum &amp; attire to match (perhaps a tanto in the waist-line?!). Takeo is the only member that never seems to contrite or enact remission, he’s just always killing it &amp; enmeshes intensity even on the very rare slower/para sections. As for Sakata, this guy makes the sax screel like a banshee, constantly bursting the nerve with those high pitched strained screamers &amp; super-fast prismic- paracemes.

  He endows some of the most emotive &amp; non-rational imprecation to edge-up the instability. &amp; of course we have Yosuke himself, definitely the most dynamic member who sometimes rides the current &amp; plays a series of variables (rather than solely erratic &amp; fast) &amp; fractal techniques. When not careening all over the keys with his cohorts rankled &amp; rash explosives, he mangles many forms of vaguely traditional &amp; melodic motives with the drastic &amp; dissolute free-form of aggressive improvisation &amp; Avant-Garde. Together at full reciprocity velocity, these philippic conflagrating aiguilles of remorseless jocund excess, tearing through like some kind of biblical storm, bursting &amp; inspissating with over-abundance &amp; splendorous savagery just chop the blocks like nobody’s business. Amazing! &amp; one of the best &amp; most intense Off-Road Free Jazz experiences available.
