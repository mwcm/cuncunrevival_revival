   "Everything I do, I want to swing. I think music needs to swing no matter how abstract it gets. In fact, the more abstract, the more intellectual it gets, the more it needs to swing because that's the balancing factor." -Bob Moses

   Bob Moses began playing drums at the age of ten and was composing music by the time he was fourteen. His father, Richard Moses, was a press agent for various jazz artists including Charles Mingus, Max Roacch and Rashaan Roland Kirk. He first sat in with Mingus when he was about 12 and in 1964 began playing drums on two of Roland Kirk's albums. Soon after he became an important part of the 1960s new jazz scene, playing in groups with guitarist Larry Coryell and later, in 1968 with the ground breaking Gary Burton quartet.

   After touring with famed drummer Jack DeJohnette, and saxophonist Harold Vick in 1973, he went on to play with the Mike Gibbs orchestra in 1974 and rejoined Gary Burton's group in 1974. In 1975 he recorded the brilliant trio album Bright Size Life with Pat Metheny and the late Jaco Pastorious. He also started his own record label, Mozown Records, and released Bittersuite in The Ozone and the critically acclaimed albums, When Elephants Dream of Music (1982) and Visit With The Great Spirit (1983). These two albums firmly established Moses as a highly original composer and orchestrator in addition to his percussion prowess.

   An exceedingly odd free jazz classic, Bittersuite in the Ozone was recorded in 1973 and reissued by the Brooklyn-based percussion label Amulet in 1999. It features some of the music's leading lights: bassist Eddie Gomez, drummer Billy Hart, saxophonists David Liebman and Daniel Carter, trumpeters Randy Brecker and John D'earth, tuba virtuoso Howard Johnson, vocalist Jeanne Lee, and more. Bob Moses, pictured inside with a huge hippie Afro, plays not only drums and percussion, but also vibes (on "Glitteragbas Solo") and rather excellent piano (on the sprawling epic "Stanley Free"). Compositionally, he is at his peak on the very brief, classically influenced "Message to the Music Bizness." Bittersuite is to some degree a dated period piece, but its radical aesthetic remains a touchstone of sorts for the jazz avant-garde.
