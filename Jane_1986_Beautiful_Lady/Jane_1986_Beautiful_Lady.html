   The line-up is completely upside down for this album. Peter Panka remains the only founding member who has never left the band from their debut. Another well known old chap is back on business again. Nadolny gets hold of the keys (he was also present on their debut album). He already was featured on their previous effort as a guest on the . sax (for one track).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   IMO, the most important fact here is that Klaus Hess has left "Jane". He had taken control of the band (he signed each of the tracks from "Germania" )and he had a profound influence on the "Jane" sound. It is definitely him that brought these heavy guitar oriented tracks. One might like it or not but when compared to the ones we will be served here, they should be categorized as great songs!

   When one listens to this album, it is of a complete different genre. Pop-rock all the way through. Mellow songs, uninspired for most of them. The "Buggles" oriented "Hold Your Line" being one of the bearable songs from "Beautiful Lady".

   Almost no more great guitar solo (there is only a short one during "Hold The Line"). But taking this song as a reference says sufficiently about the quality of this album.

   Keys are dominating. But not those great ones that could be heard in "Jane". Far from them. Electro-pop at times, they are just not convincing (just listen to the ugly "Beautiful Lady" or "Never Let You Go").

   One heavy-funky song is vaguely reminiscent of better days. But this one features no melody, no feeling, no nothing to be honest. Another weak song (but it is the sixth one so far). This album is a complete mess. The real killing being reached during "Imagination" in which the band will include a part of the great "Imagine" in the midst of a flat song. Poor John. You didn't deserve this. Please RIP and forgive this.

   Even if "Germania" was not a good effort, it still delivered some average to good compositions. I can't find any good one here. Only one average.
