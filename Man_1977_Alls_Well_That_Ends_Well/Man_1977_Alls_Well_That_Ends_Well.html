  The very definition of the contractual obligation album, All's Well That Ends Well is a live record recorded at London's Roundhouse less than a week before Man's split in 1976 and released in place of the album that was supposed to come from the fractious and ultimately unproductive studio sessions that had led to the band's dissolution. Nearly half the songs come from the recent Welsh Connection album, the others being mainstays of the live act like a rubbery, almost disco-tinged version of the standard "Spunk Rock." The one new song, the opening "Let the Good Times Roll," is actually quite good, a bluesy pub rocker featuring some swell organ work by Phil Ryan and a typically excellent performance by drummer Terry Williams, but the rest of the album, particularly the three tracks from the rather subpar Welsh Connection, is rather dispirited and dull. Man would eventually reunite in various permutations of the classic lineup, but to coin another clich√©, All's Well That Ends Well proves only that all good things must come to an end.
