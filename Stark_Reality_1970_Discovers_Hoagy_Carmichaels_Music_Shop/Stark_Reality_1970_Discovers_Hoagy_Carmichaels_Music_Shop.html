   “One of the most prized ‘funk’ artifacts of all time, Stark’s project allies Henrix-stoned guitars, heavily fuzzed vibraphone and Bitches Brew rhythms” – MOJO

   Hoagy Carmichael, an active jazz musician as early as the 1920s, will forever be regarded as one of jazz music’s originators and innovators. Carmichael had his share of classics with well known tunes like “Star Dust” and “Georgia on my Mind”, but later in his career, also had his share of lesser known songs and albums, amongst them being a 1957 collection of children’s songs including songs like “Comrades” and “Grandfather Clock”, songs hardly worth mentioning when discussing his extensive discography. Over a decade after the initial release of these songs, in 1970, at which point he was long past the pinnacle of his success, Carmichael became the host of a children’s show on the American television network PBS entitled “Hoagy Carmichael’s Music Shop”. The soundtrack to the television series was provided by an obscure jazz-funk band, Stark Reality and featured the little-known act covering songs from aforementioned children’s album penned by Hoagy Carmichael himself.

   At this time, Stark Reality was comprised of four members and led by vibraphonist Monty Stark. The group also included guitarist John Abercrombie who would later go on to play on various notable jazz fusion cuts after his days with Stark Reality. On ” The Stark Reality Discover Hoagy Carmichael’s Music Shop” the band of Berklee College of Music students were able to update the dated sound of Carmichael’s original recordings to an ultra hip sound, replacing oboes and clarinets with distorted guitar and groovy baselines. While the lyrics remain the same as in the original recordings, Monty and his gang transform Carmichael’s songs into something unrecognizable, yet all the more remarkable.

   Its incredibly difficult to attempt to describe the sound Stark Reality accomplished on this album. In some ways it is very similar to more common jazz fusion releases of the early 1970s but the one factor that sets the album apart is that it features vocals, something rather uncommon for jazz fusion, yet certainly a welcomed addition to the album with Monty Stark’s unique and warm style of singing. The Carmichael penned lyrics sometimes do not come into play until well over five minutes into a song following long segments of John Abercrombie managing to get the most unusual sounds possible out of his guitar and solos on what sounds like a distorted Fender Rhodes Piano. These extended jam sessions over high pitched bass lines and ride cymbals tend to have a sort of dark feel to them, making it hard to comprehend how this music appealed to children. “Comrades” has an especially spooky feel to it until two minutes in when the innocent, child-friendly lyrics kick in.

   Despite the unique style of “Stark Reality Discovers Hoagy Carmichael’s Music Shop”, it is very listener friendly (probably as a result of it being geared toward children).This being one of the first jazz albums I listened to I can say with confidence it is a good album for even those who have not spent a lot of time investigating jazz music or jazz fusion. Due to it’s rarity and extensive selection of breaks, this album has become a sort of holy grail for beat-diggers and record collectors, resulting in an original copy having a price tag of $1000 + (USD) these days. The casual listener is not likely to shell out that much cash on one album, however, this album is certainly worthy of a download from amazon or iTunes made possible by Now Again Records’ 2003 re-release of this classic fusion material.

   This review is for the 2013, 3 CD set by THE STARK REALITY. This is the restored and remastered tracks from the original tapes. Unlike past reissues, this set collects all the known music recorded by this group. Included (with correct lower case letters) is the complete "discovers Hoagy Carmichael's Music Shop", "roller coaster ride", and "acting, thinking, feeling" albums. There's a 52 page booklet that's attached to the inside of one (of two) of the (stiff cardboard) bill-fold style CD holders. There's an essay on the music along with some great photos of Monty Stark as a young boy. There's also information and photos of the band members. Also included is recording information for each album. Each disc fits inside a paper slip case for protection from scratches, and slips inside a side slot. Everything fits into a stiff cardboard slipcase-with cool color graphics. The sound (using headphones) is very good-clean and open with no apparent harshness. All in all, a very nice presentation.

   For something a little different, you might want to check this out. The band consists of Monty Stark-vibes/voice, Phil Morrison-bass, John Abercrombie-guitar, and Vinnie Johnson-drums. Is this a jazz album? No, not strictly. There's also elements of funk and rock, mixed in with jazz underpinnings. At times you can hear just a bit of psychedelia mixed in, which gives this music even more of an identity. Abercrombie's guitar is oftentimes fuzzed out, other times he sounds reminiscent of his later electric work for the ECM label. The electric bass is prominent-laying down a funky base (listen to "Grandfather's Clock") for both Stark and Abercrombie. And talking about Stark-his vibes (also sometimes fuzzed out) are a combination of jazz and something else that can't be exactly defined. But (and here's the weird thing) it all seems to work. Even the vocals have that funky feel to them. Let's face it-you're talking about Hoagy Carmichael tunes after all. This music will put a smile on your face. And that's not a put down or an excuse because the music isn't all that great. The music is great-the smile is extra.

   Included in this collection are the first known recordings by this band (cut for radio), the bigger band pieces, and the Carmichael album in full. This music was recorded in the late 60's/1970 when jazz was changing and fans were open to different sounds and different approaches to music. As I said previously, this is hard to define. It's jazz, it's funk, it's psychedelic, and it's Carmichael's songs on one album. The bigger band album incorporates several horns, a couple of bass players, a couple of percussionists, and a few other instruments. The music is reminiscent of late 60's big band arrangements-or perhaps something by Mingus-or some other forward thinking composer. The arrangements are seemingly loose but are written out-the twists and turns of the music are too sharp for free-jazz (or whatever you want to label it), and are quite energetic. At times I'm also reminded of some of Bill Dixon's more energetic compositions from the 1980's or 90's, or sometimes a bit of Sun Ra. The music changes from big band style charts("on being black") to something pretty funky ("new world generation"), which keeps the interest up. Several hearings will reward listeners with a better understanding of what's going on, and a deeper enjoyment of the music.

   Obviously this isn't for everyone. The Hoagy Carmichael kid's songs will put off some, the vocal parts (which are well done) will put others off, and the whole jazz/funk/psych label will make others think twice. I have a sneaking suspicion that this will be met with excitement only by people who are already familiar with THE STARK REALITY. John Abercrombie fans will like hearing him early in his career, and Stark's fuzzed vibes are jazz and something else at the same time. The funky rhythms laid down by Morrison and Johnson keep things moving, and the arrangements are well thought out. No matter if it's the small band or the larger ensemble, this is something unique-as opposed to "weird", which it isn't. Check it out if you want something off the usual path. It'll grow on you.

   "Acting, Thinking, Feeling marks the first time that psychedelic jazz ensemble The Stark Reality's Discovers Hoagy Carmichael's Music Shop album has been reissued in full (the 2003 Stones Throw Records anthology Now only contained half of the original album's music). The anthology also contains the band's out-of-print Roller Coaster Ride (first issued as 1969 on Now-Again in 2003), and a series of recently discovered, previously-unreleased tracks in a three CD 'complete works' box set. Besides the missing Hoagy Carmichael's Music Shop songs, the most exciting additions to the Stark Reality's oeuvre are the three songs recorded between the earliest incarnation of the band -- the big band that recorded 'Theme to Say Brother' and 'Acting, Thinking, Feeling' in 1968 -- and the slimmed down combo that recorded the Roller Coaster Ride and The Stark Reality Discovers Hoagy Carmichael's Music Shop. These recordings display a band in flux, and color the development of Stark's genius. We hear the signature sound of his 'plugged in' vibes for the first time; we hear an early stab at the psychedelic 'Red Yellow Moonbeams' (and realize why his addition John Abercrombie and his fuzz guitar was crucial to his vision); we hear a subtle change towards a more funk and rock based sound. Contains 52-page booklet with never before seen photos, extensive liner notes and annotation."
