   Apparently, Airto’s tenure with CTI didn’t last all that long, since 74’s Virgin Land album was released on the CTI-subsidiary Kudu-Salvation label, but this included a fairly different set of supporting guest musicians, with only wife Flora and bassist Stanley Clarke present from the CTI days. But other well-known guest include George Duke, David Amaro, and Billy Cobham behind the production desk in Hendrix’ old Electric Lady studios.

   Opening on the ultra-funk of the Clarke-penned 100 MPH Stanley’s Tune, Virgin Land is off to a flying start, only to be confirmed with the DeLorme–written Musikana that seems to be written for (unannounced) didgeridoo. Closing the A-side is the Santana-inspired title track (just after a rather free-dissonant intro), where Airto’s bass vocals provide some cool sonic effects, and we’re crossing the desert on a Caravanserai trip.

   On the flipside, there are four (relatively) shorter tracks, the first of which is a Klezmer-infected fast funk (almost disco) groove Peasant Dance from Milcho Leviev (on keyboards) with some clarinet to boot. The gentler slightly mid-eastern infected Lydian Riff follows, but the track s too long for its own good, despite some far-tripping light Egyptian ambiances. Things pick up with the upbeat Hot Sand, a funky Arp-synth-dominated (courtesy of Duke) piece, where Airto’s percussions and vocals are all over the place. The closing and rockier Don’t Have To Do sounds a bit like a Peter Frampton tune, with a vocoder-guitar coming alive throughout the track, sometimes underlined by a mellotron. Weird stuff.

   A rather strange album, definitely more even than the schizophrenic Free album, Virgin Land can’t really be called JR/F, but it doesn’t fit the funk-soul-jazz mould either, but it’s probably Airto’s finer solo album discography moment.

   A great little fusion set from Airto – recorded in a mode that's a great bridge between his acoustic roots and some of his smoother albums in years to come! The sound has some key electric elements here – bits of bass, guitar, and keyboards – but there's still a strongly acoustic sound overall too, one that leaves plenty of room for Airto's unique jams on percussion, plus a bit of vocals from the lovely Flora Purim. Airto's got some top-shelf talents helping him out here – Billy Cobham on production, and Stanley Clarke and Milcho Leviev on arrangements – and there's a nice sense of darkness going on that even separates the album from some of Airto's other mid 70s sides on CTI.

   An all-star cast accompanies Brazilian percussion master Airto Moreira on this percolating collection of jazz fusion pieces. Produced by drummer extraordinaire Billy Cobham, the album locks into a steamy groove on Stanley Clarke's "Stanley's Tune" and never lets up. The Middle Eastern flavor of some of the melodies, Moreira and wife Flora Purim's unique vocalizations, and the use of unusual instrumentation on several cuts help make this recording a unique highlight of the electric fusion era. Standout soloists include Eddie Daniels on clarinet and guitarists David Amaro and Gabriel DeLorme, while bassist Clarke provides his usual stellar performance.
