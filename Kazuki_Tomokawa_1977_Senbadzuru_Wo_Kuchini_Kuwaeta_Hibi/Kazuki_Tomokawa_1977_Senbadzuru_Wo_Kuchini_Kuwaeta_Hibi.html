   Kazuki Tomokawa, with Senbazuru wo Kuchini Kuwaeta Hibi, as a favored treatment of artistic personalities from the northern provinces, signed his first collaboration with JA Seazer, a major producer of the seventies, gravitating in the high spheres of the avant-garde theater -guard alongside the priceless writer, playwright and filmmaker Shuji Terayama. After Morita Doji, Seazer joins Tomokawa to work on a studio album in total break with Kansai folk; The fashion (at least, that of the margin) is to the psychedelic decomplexed and the musical arrangements sought. It is obvious from the starting blocks with the presence of a real good instrumental theme. From the scale, from the drama - listen to the cello of "What's Happened": clearly, Accompaniment is much better worked and seductive in its form. Tomokawa is suddenly more accessible to everyone, through this graft in the vein of Tenjo Sajiki ("Memory"). The maestria of Seazer is undeniable, his reputation far from being usurped, helped by Takeshi Mori on guitar. Farewell folk rock plan-plan, place to the cavalcades in the countries of an exotic prog on the border of art rock. "NaMaHaGe" sends a funky bass line in 5/8, well-felt flute arrows, the battery strikes more by chasing the synths: it swings, it swings and waddles with a small side Ennio Morricone without diluting In fact) the nerves in ball of the principal interpreter. "Say with Conviction, I am Alive" is the direct affirmation, It is the best-known title of Tomokawa, a hymn to the life of all concerts that never does in half measure. Two other notable hits, intended for a single ("Kids in the Town of Hachiryu") whose face B "Runaway Boy" is a classic of a formidable efficiency. Coated with subtle arrangements that give a hellfishing fishing to neat texts, the album is undoubtedly the best possible mise en bouche possible for anyone who would like to discover the howler philosopher by the seventies box, without leaving feathers there. Even the mandatory passage on the traditional terrain is passed to the magic sieve of the man with the wand - once listened, the exalting "Don-Pan Bushi Carousing" risks squatting skulls for quite a while. It is a small miracle that everything is so well taken away. Senbazuru is a pretty pavement in the pond on which you wiggle in spite of a share of shade very present; A pleasure not so guilty, for never Tomokawa seems withdrawn. On the contrary, he sings of the timeless without conforming to more formal expectations: "An Ode To A Failed Death", a psychedelic apex with the stunning violin part, arises thus gently on the opening theme of the album in outro . Energetic and powerful. Opening of the album in outro. Energetic and powerful. Opening of the album in outro. Energetic and powerful.
