   Idris Muhammad was born on November 13,1939, and began playing the drums at age 8 in his native New Orleans. By the time he was 16, he was performing in jazz bands. Muhammad became known as one of the most innovative drummers in soul music of the 1960's, performing with singers Sam Cooke, Jerry Butler, and The Impressions.

   He played for the popular musical Hair while performing with the house band for the Prestige Label in the early 1970's. For the rest of that decade, he accompanied popular singer Roberta Flack, led his own band, and worked with Johnny Griffin and Pharaoh Sanders.

   An excellent drummer who has appeared in many types of settings, Idris Muhammad became a professional when he was 16. He played primarily soul and R&amp;B during 1962-1964 and then spent 1965-1967 as a member of Lou Donaldson's band. He was the house drummer at Prestige Records (1970-1972), appearing on many albums as a sideman. Of his later jazz associations, Muhammad played with Johnny Griffin (1978-1979), Pharoah Sanders in the 1980s, George Coleman, and the Paris Reunion Band (1986-1988). He has recorded everything from post-bop to dance music as a leader for such labels as Prestige, Kudu, Fantasy, Theresa, and Lipstick.

   First off, this isn't one of those sit-around-with-your-forehead-balled-up-manically-chewing-your-fingernails-tryna-microanalyze-each-and-every-nanosecond type records. This is some good solid groove-based soul jazz flavor, perfect for people who want to hear big Idris putting it down in groove mode just prior to his predominantly saccharine CTI stint as a bandleader.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Well-rocked, breakish rhythms infused throughout this tasty selection of cuts drive the recording, yielding a tight-yet-live, upbeat feel and and some serious repeat listenability.

   With a title like "Black Rhythm Revolution!" (and especially that "!" at the end), you'd expect something bold, relentless and perhaps even radical. That's just not the case here though, the title is a tad misleading. Instead, it's a collection that highlights the generosity between musicians. Hardly any single person, including Idris himself, lets their ego get the best of them in an attempt to outshine the other musicians.....no, they all work in harmony as a unified force. There is one song though where Idris shines the light on himself with a powerful and provocative drum solo - "Wander" - and it's righteous beyond belief. He peppers subtle rhythmic polyrhythms against the solid beat structure and it's done in a really forward thinking way. It's a damn near thorough exploration of a groove and it's possibilities. Outside of that dynamic highlight, the rest of the album is solid soul-jazz that doesn't force itself on the listener, but also doesn't hide from the fact that it's ear-candy. It's admirable almost more for what's not on it (flashy show-off for ego's sake) than what's actually coming out of the speakers. Good stuff!
