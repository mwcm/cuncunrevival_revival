  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A nice collection of "rare Arkestra recordings from the late 1960's, made in and around 42nd Street, New York City, Planet Earth." Sketchy details on personnel and dates but that hardly matters - "Somewhere in Space" with its "underwater" vocal and great Gilmore solo, plus the closing "Next Stop Mars" and the psychedelically reverbed piano on "Song of Tree and Forest" make this worthwhile in itself, but the rest of the tracks range from interesting to really good as well, and nothing is less than enjoyable here. Not an easy one to find these days, and nothing I'd say is so essential that you *need* to seek it out, but snap it up if you come across it.

   The 13 selections on this CD by a small group taken from Sun Ra's Arkestra are generally both explorative and introspective. The combo includes tenor-saxophonist John Gilmore, altoist Marhsall Allen, baritonist Pat Patrick, an occasional trumpeter and trombonist (the personnel is not listed), Ra's organ, piano and primitive electric keyboards plus a bassist, drummer and some percussionists. The performances are mostly short sketches that set spacey moods and then fade out; Ra's piano sounds surprisingly like Thelonious Monk in spots. The odd echo devices and spooky keyboards give this eccentric music much atmosphere. The violent ensemble number "Other Worlds" and the lengthy "Next Stop Mars" are changes of pace (sounding like the 1966 John Coltrane Quintet) while many of the other pieces would work well as soundtracks to a science fiction movie. Although not essential, these futuristic sounds from the past hold one's interest.
