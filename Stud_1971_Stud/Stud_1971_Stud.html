  Stud began as a trio with Jim Cregan (ex Blossom Toes) (vocals, guitar), Richard McCracken (bass) and John Wilson (drums), the latter pair having split with Rory Gallagher's Taste on 31st December 1970. They were signed by Deram Records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ex Family violinist John Weider joined the band in June 1971, in time to appear on the debut LP which was released to little acclaim. While the musicianship on show is top notch, some of the material lacks distinction and meanders too often. The LP sold poorly and Deram declined the option of a second LP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The band had more success in Germany, where Polydor had released the debut in different cover artwork.The album was recorded for Decca's Deram label and was an amalgam of rock and jazz and was an outstanding progressive album of its time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sessions also featured guest appearances by Poli Palmer (of Family) and John Weider (ex-Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals and Family). Although Stud never achieved the acclaim they deserved, their debut album remains highly sought after by aficionados of Progressive Rock.
