   Mike Nock is a New Zealand pianist who had been playing with some of the top names in jazz in the U.S., and he assembled an 'all star' band for this straight ahead jazz CD.

   It features astounding playing by Mike Brecker. According to a recent discography, Brecker has now appeared on more than 150 CD's, so, I can't say this is his best record, but it is surely one of the best. The other Brecker CD's that I have heard are fusion, and I will hypothesize that because of the heavy funk supplied by a fusion rhythm section, the horn is required to play less, and as a result, Brecker coasts. Of course, Brecker coasts at 200 mph. However, on this record there is no electric bass, no drum machine, and no coasting. Brecker plays a long solo on the title cut that is at the limit start to finish. His usual ferocious technique is on display, and this time it is coupled with an emotional intensity that makes this solo like a roller coaster ride, with the excitement of hair-pin turns and the exhiliration of free fall. At his best, Brecker is awesome.
