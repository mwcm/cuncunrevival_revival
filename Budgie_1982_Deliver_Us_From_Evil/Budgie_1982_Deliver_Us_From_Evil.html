  Budgie. One of the most underrated among hard rocking and heavy metal bands on this planet. "Deliver Us from Evil" had been their last effort before the project was on hiatus for more than two decades? The album starts with a solid rocker "Bored With Russia" and this is a promising opener. Unfortunately next three tracks are of very poor musical quality. The band seem to try to follow NWOBHM standards, however, they are far behind Iron Maiden, Leppard and Saxon (to name a few) abilities to produce at least decent tracks. I would say, a relegation zone of the second division regarding NWOBHM at that time. The last song of the 1st side of the Lp is much better though; "Flowers in the Attic", a nice tune, comparable to "Bored With Russia". The second side of the vinyl is somewhat better. "N.O.R.A.D.", one of my favourite ones on the album. "Give Me The Truth" and "Finger On The Button" are poor again and easily forgotten. "Alison" is a quite controversial one for Budgie, more a pop song than a power ballad. Personally, I like it, and, surprise, surprise? I can hear a bit of John Lennon in it (hence his name at the back of the cover?). And finally, another Budgie classic and absolutely epic one ? "Hold On To Love". Fast pace reminds me a bit "Hard Loving Man" of Deep Purple. I hesitated between two and three stars for the album. Eventually for I am a fan of the Welsh trio I tipped the scale toward three stars. I am very pleased to add, that there is a short text at the back of the cover in Polish. "We would like to thank veeeeeeeery much to those in poland who came to see us live. You are the best audience we have ever played for. Budgie." The band was nearly as popular as Black Sabbath in my country (Yes, I am Polish). Why? There was no regular record market behind the iron curtain and courtesy of Piotr Kaczkowski, a radio DJ, me and legions of rock fans are familiar with the impressing flight of Welsh budgies.
