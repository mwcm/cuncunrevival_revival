  The story of Diabolus is similar to many of their peers, those unfortunate but talented outfits doomed for oblivion. Only, that is, to be rediscovered years later and thus gaining some recognition. It has to be said, however, that Diabolus is still a very unknown band which deservedly ought to be slightly more appreciated by a larger group of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First I'd like to give Diabolus the bad news. They are not really groundbreaking. There. With that said I would like to put forth the good news. Those are that the sole album by this band is a great mixture of all that was happening in the music scene back then, and really the british scene since they are from the UK. The music is a blend of jazz-rock, folk and progressive leanings. I can recall sounds of Jethro Tull, Gravy Train, Cressida, Julian Jay Savarin, Black Widow, Sunday and others from around 1969-1972. It is to me a very pleasant sounding mix, filling me with joy and goose bumps. Though warm it is still sort of ominous and exciting. Diabolus managed to produce an album of highly creative music and resembles the vision of a band bubbling with commitment to music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would say that all tracks are very good and none of the songs stick out in a bad way, which sometimes can be the case. The songs are really well matched, though they are different from each other. Ranging from gentleness to all out raucious jazz-rock, the tapestry is a highly intelligent and enjoyable one. I cannot really pick out any track as the superior one, it is really a matter of picking anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flute, keyboards and drums are all there, alongside great guitar playing and good vocals. If you are into vintage prog this could well be an album for you. Splendid, magnificent and sadly overlooked it is a great piece of history from a time when progressive music really was in it's prime and making. Top stuff!
