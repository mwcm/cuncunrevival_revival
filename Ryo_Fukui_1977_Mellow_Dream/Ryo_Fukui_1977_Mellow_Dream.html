   Ryo Fukui's second input which is a great addition to the modal jazz movement. Comparing this album to his first release, "Scenery" would be a bit unfair, because this is different and shows Fukui going towards a different direction. This is a much more energetic, and bombastic album which features an AMAZING, and almost dance-able song called "Horizon." It's a 9 minute trip which ultimately reminds me of racing to a finish line, which pretty much sums up the speed of the song, which compliments the composition perfectly. I feel like Ryo Fukui is definitely not a generic jazz musician either, because you can just feel his personality running through these songs, and if you haven't heard his first album, I highly recommend that you do so, because it shows him at his best, while this album almost reaches that peak. What drags this album down is that some parts seem to lose momentum and overall drag songs such as "Baron Potato Blues."
