  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   John Lennon's fourth solo album, Mind Games, was recorded at the beginning of the Lost Weekend, his separation from Yoko Ono. It showed Lennon moving away from the politics of Some Time In New York City, and a return to more introspective songwriting.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Bruised by the public and critical backlash against Some Time In New York City, John Lennon moved away from radical politics and activism. He retreated from recording music for more than a year and continued his efforts to remain in the United States.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In May 1973 he and Yoko Ono moved from Greenwich Village to a 12-room apartment at the Dakota near Manhattan's Central Park. The couple had been drifting apart, however, and she had busied herself recording the albums Approximately Infinite Universe and Feeling The Space.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Lennon worked on a number of song ideas which he recorded in demo form, but was aware that his confidence as a musician had taken a knock. The boundless creativity which had driven his early solo works was lacking, yet he set about crafting a set of solid yet uninspired songs.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Using many of the same session musicians Ono had employed on Feeling The Space, Lennon entered New York's Record Plant East studio to begin work on the album. Mind Games was completed within a period lasting around two weeks, with Lennon producing himself. The band was credited as the Plastic U.F.Ono Band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Significantly, the period also marked the beginning of Lennon's 16-month separation from Yoko Ono, and the start of his relationship with May Pang and the time he later dubbed the Lost Weekend. She had been the couple's personal assistant since 1971 and had been asked by Ono to become Lennon's partner in order to discourage him from seeing other women.

    "Well, first I thought, Whoopee! Bachelor life! Whoopee, whoopee! And then I woke up one day and thought, What is this? I want to go home. But she wouldn't let me come home. That's why it was eighteen months instead of six."

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mind Games captured this state of flux in Lennon's life. The songs ranged from aimless fillers (Intuition, Bring On The Lucie, Only People) to up-tempo rockers (Tight A$, Meat City). The lack of a unifying theme hadn't prevented Lennon from producing great work in the past, as demonstrated on Imagine, but Mind Games lacked enough great moments to mask the sense that this once-great composer and performer was treading water.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Several of the songs, inevitably, were about Ono, and were among the most effective on the album. Out The Blue, Aisumasen (I'm Sorry) and I Know (I Know) detailed his regret at losing her, while One Day (At A Time) and You Are Here explored the theme of two star-crossed lovers destined to be together.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The title track, along with Bring On The Lucie (Freeda Peeple) and Only People, showed that Lennon hadn't lost his belief in peace or the power of people to change the world, even if the results lacked the conviction and drive of his earlier solo work.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The three-second silent track Nutopian International Anthem, meanwhile, showed that even if he hadn't lost his skill at subverting expectations, there was little radical spirit to back it up. The conceptual country Nutopia had been announced by Lennon and Ono in a press release issued on 1 April 1973, and at a press conference the following day.

    "[Mind Games] was originally called 'Make Love Not War, but that was such a clich√© that you couldn't say it anymore, so I wrote it obscurely, but it's all the same story. How many times can you say the same thing over and over? When this came out, in the early Seventies, everybody was starting to say the Sixties was a joke, it didn't mean anything, those love-and-peaceniks were idiots. [Sarcastically] 'We all have to face the reality of being nasty human beings who are born evil and everything's gonna be lousy and rotten so boo-hoo-hoo...''We had fun in the Sixties,' they said, 'but the others took it away from us and spoiled it all for us.' And I was trying to say: 'No, just keep doin' it.'"

   Even Lennon's skill for wordplay had largely left him, with Tight A$ (itself a subversion of the phrase 'tight ass') and Meat City ("Chickinsuckin' mothertruckin' Meat City shookdown USA") the sole exceptions. The latter song also contained one of Lennon's favourite curses, "Fuck a pig," played backwards and sped up.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   John Lennon designed the artwork for Mind Games himself. The front cover pictured him alone in a wilderness, overshadowed by a mountain-sized rendering of Yoko Ono. The meaning was obvious: he was adrift without Ono, although her influence was still the dominant force in his life.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

    "I think I really needed some space because I was used to being an artist and free and all that, and when I got together with John, because we're always in the public eye, I lost the freedom. And also, both of us were together all the time, twenty-four hours a day. And the pressure was particularly strong on me because of being the one who stole John Lennon from the public or something... Whatever the reason is, I was under very strong pressure and I think my artwork suffered. I suffered a lot and so I thought I want to be free from all that. I needed the space to think. So I thought it would be a good idea that he would go to LA and just leave me alone for a while."

   In contrast to Some Time In New York City, Mind Games was well received by the public. In the United States it peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, was certified gold, and spent 31 weeks on the chart.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album reached number 13 in the United Kingdom, and was also certified gold in May 1974. Mind Games was in the UK album chart for a total of 12 weeks.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   Tony King, who worked as a promotions executive for Apple Records in Los Angeles, encouraged Lennon to give several print and radio interviews in support of the album.

    "While he had been with Yoko he had been involved with all these semi-subversive activities, which had not given him a great reputation in America. He said to me at the time, 'Look, I've got this album, what do you think I should do?' I said, 'Honestly, you've got to go out and make a few friends, because you've lost a bit of support because you've been involved with things of a controversial nature.' So he said, 'Fine, you organise it, I'll do it.' And he did."

   Mind Games was released in November 1973. The following month, Lennon and May Pang left New York for Los Angeles, where they remained until June 1974. Their spell on the West Coast saw Lennon embrace a drink-fuelled lifestyle which led to the often chaotic sessions for Walls And Bridges and Rock 'N' Roll. In comparison, the backdrop to Mind Games looked positively tranquil.

   John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Imagine. Some Time in New York City. What next? Yes, it was called Mind Games.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   John Lennon's early solo career was a series of large size cultural/musical happenings. Think about the world peace manifestation of "Give Peace a Chance", the political stand-taking on "Working Class Hero" and "Power to the People", the sugar-coated communist manifesto also known as "Imagine", the radical left wing frenzy of Some Time in New York City, the 'Lost Weekend' stamp of Walls and Bridges, the close circle abusing songs ("How Do You Sleep", "Steel and Glass") as well as the famous personal-to-universal, universal-to-personal love declarations ("Love"&amp; "Oh My Love"). What I am trying to say is that each and every John Lennon recording of those days was a socio-cultural manifestation, a movement, a special act. That is why, if it is Lennon, it is at least three stars (well, if it is full standard music, let's add). Some Time in New York City does not deserve more than three because "Woman Is the Nigger of the World" was the only fine performance on it. But even though Mind Games lacks songs I would call true classics (in terms of my own classification, again), it has the John Lennon quality. Three and half because of that.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The 'classic' songs on this album are among the first ‚Äì the title track, naturally, and "One Day (at a Time)." The opening title track is a nice piece of music, and it makes clear that John's most furious NY radical period is over. I am not sure because I wasn't even born at the date but I guess many "All You Need Is Love" / "Imagine" hippies must have been relieved hearing the artist sing about 'mind games' and declare 'love is the answer' (or even 'yes is the answer'‚Äì despite the fierce radicalism, John was still the person they knew from The Beatles, he who fell in love with that Japanese woman and pursued a solo career). "One Day (at a Time)", then, is my favourite song on the album. It isn't "Oh My Love" or "Bless You", but musically, you can certainly draw a line from the former to the latter via this one. Beside the rockers, John always (except on Some Time, say) had those sensitive loving moments which he, for some reason, began to shape into more and more nightclubbing form. Interesting!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Rockers, by the way, exist on Mind Games within the shape of "Tight A$" and "Meat City." The latter contains a couple of nice beat-and-chord changes, but the point is that the rockers are not the point. The most distinct social comments on the album can be heard on "Bring on the Lucie (Freda Peeple)" and "Only People"; however, they aren't among the most essential Lennon protest songs. In fact, "Only People" sounds a bit like the New Seekers' Coca-Cola hit, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.""You Are Here" surprises the listener while it is quite much country but despite that (and the nightclub feel that appears in "One Day (at a Time)" now and then), on Mind Games, musical crossoverism is not the point. "Out the Blue", "Intuition" and "Aisumasen" are absolutely nice songs but in a case like this even that seems not to be the point either.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   So, what is the substance of the matter on Mind Games? I think the main point is that Mind Games was ‚Äì back in 1973 ‚Äì a new true John Lennon album on which the artist showed the world he was not over, neither as a musician nor as a person who walked the road he had chosen. Mind Games is the continuity. And while it is so, Mind Games is also one of the biggest cultural/musical happenings of 1973, like George Harrison's Living in the Material World in its own category. Because of that, the """""track""""" which almost seems to describe the album's nature best is "Nutopian International Anthem": a song that doesn't exist (or three seconds of nothing), being a bold socio-political comment because it doesn't exist (and this isn't a hoot ‚Äì just think of the title, Nutopian International Anthem, can you see?). Funnily perhaps, Mind Games is an album whose greatest meaning is its existence, not its content. Thank you for making it, John, even though unfortunately my thankyou may be a little late, like, over 45 years.

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mind Games is, to my knowledge, the first release from the conceptual country Nutopia, whose existence John and Yoko proclaim in a Declaration on the lyric sheet. Oddly enough, it isn‚Äôt all that different from the records he has been making in America these last few years. Those have revealed a steady decline from the high points of his post-Beatle work, Plastic Ono Band and ‚ÄúInstant Karma.‚Äù There, he distilled his simplistic humanism into a single moving statement of belief ‚Äî at once his most accessible and intelligent attempt at autobiography and philosophy.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   With Imagine he began affecting attitudes bereft of emotional force. As he turned to petty gossip and didactic social commentary, his gambit of combining simple thoughts with simple music backfired. What was moving when applied to his own life was unbearably pretentious when used to offer aphorisms concerning larger issues.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Musically, Mind Games is a return to the form of Plastic Ono Band, employing some of the same simple chord progressions, similar instrumentation, and tunes that on closer inspection prove devoid of melodies, consisting only of pleasant collections of pop song, gospel and folk-rock cliches, particularly dependent on Dylan‚Äôs apocalyptic mid-Sixties style.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album‚Äôs music might have served as the basis for a good LP if it had been paired with some new lyrical insight and passion. But instead, Lennon has come up with his worst writing yet. With lines like, ‚ÄúA million heads are better than one/So come on, get it on,‚Äù a listener can only accept or reject them. I‚Äôve done the latter.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Lennon‚Äôs lyrics aren‚Äôt offensive, per se ‚Äî just misguided in so underrating his audience‚Äôs intelligence. John Lennon‚Äôs admirers do not need to be preached at about the importance of love. They might even be able to withstand something more challenging than the repetition of the hollow shells of ideas they already share. But then, perhaps Lennon‚Äôs didacticism, preaching and banality are part of the mind game of the album‚Äôs title, yet another attempt to push his luck to the brink of self-annihilation.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mind Games remains listenable, which is certainly more than can be said for Some Time in New York City. Lennon‚Äôs voice is in good shape, his production a cut above average and his performance occasionally forces us to take him more seriously than we would if he seemed less determined. ‚ÄúMind Games,‚Äù ‚ÄúOne Day,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntuition‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnly People‚Äù (with some lines remarkably reminiscent of ‚ÄúRevolution‚Äù) all have one or another touch to recommend at least a few listenings.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mind Games reveals another major artist of the Sixties lost in the changing social and musical environment of the Seventies, helplessly trying to impose his own gargantuan ego upon an audience that has already absorbed his insights and is now waiting hopefully for him to chart a new course.
