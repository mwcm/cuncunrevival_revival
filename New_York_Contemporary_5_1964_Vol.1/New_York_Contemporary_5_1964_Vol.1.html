   The New York Contemporary Five was an avant-garde jazz ensemble active in the first half of the 1960s.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It has been described as "a group which, despite its ... short lease on life, has considerable historical significance", laying "the cornerstone of what might be called the mainstream of free jazz".

   The ensemble was formed around 1962 by Don Cherry, Archie Shepp, John Tchicai, Don Moore, and J.C. Moses. They released two albums in 1963 for Fontana and Sonet, and finally a split album with Bill Dixon early in 1964 on Savoy Records. The last record featured Ted Curson, Ronnie Boykins, and Sunny Murray in place of Cherry, Moore, and Moses respectively. The group disbanded later in 1964.

   This historically significant LP has six selections recorded by the New York Contemporary Five on November 11, 1963. The short-lived group, which consists of cornetist Don Cherry, altoist John Tchicai, Archie Shepp on tenor, bassist Don Moore, and drummer J.C. Moses, was avant-garde for the period, influenced most by Ornette Coleman's Quartet; the participation of Coleman's cornetist certainly helped. However, Tchicai (although sometimes hinting at Coleman) had a different approach than Coleman, and it was obvious that Shepp had already developed his own original voice and was the group's most passionate soloist. Together this very interesting quintet (which would soon break up) performs pieces by Coleman, Thelonious Monk (there's a short melodic renditions of "Crepescule with Nellie"), Bill Dixon, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry.
