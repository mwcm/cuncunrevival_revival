  The first of two fine guitar duet recordings with Phillip Catherine. Of the two, Catherine's sound is more rooted in the tradition of Django Reinhardt and tends to be more introspective. Coryell is his usual incorrigible self; however, Catherine's presence seemed to inspire more experimentation and intelligent playing on Coryell's part. As expected, this session will appeal primarily to guitarists -- and for good reason, as both players exploit their chops -- but it should be noted that the compositions here are quite memorable. Whether soloing over one riff ("Mortgage on Your Soul"), playing the blues ("Twin House"), or showing off ("Airpower"), this is an excellent collaboration and one of Coryell's most ambitious performances.

  1st album by this magnificent guitar duo: American Larry Coryell and Belgian Philip Catherine, both established virtuosi with impressive record, who cooperate here to combine their talents in order to create a whole, which is even greater than the sum of its parts. Although both guitarists are mostly known for their activity in Jazz-Rock Fusion, this album presents them in completely acoustic setting, exchanging riffs, chords and ideas. The result is a beautiful conversation of two Masters, both technically and aesthetically awe inspiring. The music on this album was mostly written by Catherine, but they also play one Keith Jarrett composition and a striking version of a Django Reinhardt tune. Guitar enthusiasts will find this album essential listening, but it is interesting to every Jazz lover. This album was unavailable for so many years and seeing it back in circulation is a great pleasure. Enjoy!
