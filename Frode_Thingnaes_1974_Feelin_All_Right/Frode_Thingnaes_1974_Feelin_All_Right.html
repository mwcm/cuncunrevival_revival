   Feelin Alright is Frode Thingnaes first album. It is considered a Norwegian jazz masterpiece from 1974, a true holy grail amongst jazz collectors. It sells for high amounts online. It was originally released in small quantities with very limited distribution, mainly in Norway. Recorded in the 70's, combining funk, folk songs, jazz and soul, makes it an unique album that represents the contemporary 70's jazz scene in Norway.
