   In the present day, when we think of "Hendrix Albums", we think of the three studio and one live record released during his lifetime, with everything else being various degrees of salvage.  This wasn't the mindset of the era, or the mindset Alan Douglas was working with on this record or the equally infamous "Crash Landing" from the same year.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "New" Hendrix albums sold really well for quite some time after his death, and the label didn't want to give up on one of their hot stars, regardless of the fact that he'd been dead for five years.  The Hendrix purists, outraged at the effacement of the sterling harmonica work of Don [Last Name Unknown], excoriated Douglas for his work, but they'd had their day: "Loose Ends" was by any definition a "purist" release, and amply demonstrated that there just wasn't enough left in the vaults for a "New Hendrix Album" of any degree of quality.  If the demand is, in 1975, for a "New Jimi Hendrix Album", pretty much your only option is to just start making shit up.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Which is what Douglas did.  "Crash Landing" and "Midnight Lightning" offer the peculiar spectacle of Hendrixsploitation records that happen to feature Jimi Hendrix, and I'd argue that they should be judged as such.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And on these grounds it's... OK.  Certainly better than the Purple Fox record, but not as good as the Live Experience Band or Chico Magnetic Band records.  Douglas wasn't trying for something unrestrainedly psychedelic, though; he was trying to put together an album of songs.  We get "studio versions" of a couple tracks that had already appeared on live albums.  Kind of silly to erase Mitch Mitchell's contributions from a track he wrote, as well as ending the album with a song called "Beginnings", but in fairness at least Douglas released the song under its proper title.  We also have a revamped version of "Blue Suede Shoes", which had just come out on 1974's "Loose Ends", and if it's still not great it does at least make a persuasive argument for erasing pretty much every drum track Buddy Miles played with Hendrix.  If the "Band of Gypsys" version of Machine Gun is too crazy for you, well, it's easy to take the purist position and say that such a person shouldn't be listening to Hendrix, but fuck it, here's a seven and a half minute bizarre frankenstein monster version that's crazy in completely different ways.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The highlight is probably the first track, a wild and heavy jam that Douglas made a song out of.  You could do a whole album of stuff like this and it'd probably be better than "Midnight Lightning".  The purists would shit.

   So this is interesting… The idea of a rock producer bringing in session dudes to fill out the sound on collected, unreleased recordings of a dead man’s tapes. The sixth album released after Hendrix’s death, these sessions have been tampered with after the fact by Alan Douglass, a record producer who controversially turned down Hendrix’s original accompanists and brought in his own talent.
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   These days the idea of remixing and retrofitting old material seems like a non-issue. And it has to be said that the work presented here is strong; it doesn’t smell like a quick cash-in by Douglass at all. Original bass and drums (with only one unmolested Mitch Mitchell track) disappear… and new guitar overdubs are placed as well! But these additions don’t take away from Hendrix’s lead, hardly fiddled with, only on demos where his repeated phrases were obviously unintentional. In a way I’m reminded of Teo Marceo’s album work for Miles Davis, but Miles was alive then and agreed with his studio ideas. Depending on what your opinion may be on his work, it may reflect about what you’d think of the Douglass edits. Is it so wrong to string such strong performances together in a studio? Or would you rather have the demos with some obvious blemishes? Serious questions when the music created originally needed so little studio tampering. These people were geniuses without it.

   But then maybe Douglass was a fitting studio-head, the one able to handle such bold work with a legend’s material. He saw an opportunity to wrap up loose ends and executed it how he saw fit. The results are striking and worth hearing, especially when you hear the power of “Machine Gun” and the rest of side two to follow. It’s a trick, but a good one.
