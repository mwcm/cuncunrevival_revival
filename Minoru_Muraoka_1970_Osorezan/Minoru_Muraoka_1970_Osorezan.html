  Minoru Muraoka was born in 1923,and began to studying shakuhachi  (=Japanese bammboo flute) officially in 1939.Later in 1959,he started to mix shakuhachi music with popular music.By playing with  Herbie Mann,a famous jazz flute plaer,in 1967,Minoru playing shakuhachi was known to  a lot of jazz fans.
  <br/>
  The album is broken down in two parts. First part was named "Soul shakuhachi" and tracks they played were American blues songs, Bossa Nova,Japanese traditional songs ,rock music....and so  on.
  <br/>
  Second part was named "New Dimension  " and the tracks they played were "Take Five""Come Together""Oiwake""Kawanakajima""Ma""Kobushi" and so on. And the last track they played was an epic "Osorezan".
  <br/>
  In this album,"Osorezan"was the first track,but actually,was the last track at the concert.
  <br/>
  In mid 70s,this album was released as the second edition with the different cover  .but one track called "Take Five"was deleted from the album.I don't know the reason.
  <br/>
  Some of Minoru Muraoka's albums are very interesting to prog fans ,however , most of them are too difficult to get for us... hint hint... lol
