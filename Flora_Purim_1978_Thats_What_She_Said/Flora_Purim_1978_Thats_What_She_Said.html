   Comparatively to other Flora Purim recordings from the 2nd half of the ‘70’s, this is the most stripped down in terms of arrangements, with no strings arrangements and only a couple of tracks with a 4tet of horns; but if the man power is reduced it’s not less effective, Flora having picked some of her favorite collaborators and having asked them to contribute with their own compositions, the final result being a fiery demonstration of her unique take on vocals - or use of the voice as a full fledged instrument -, on a Fusion register infected with Funky and Latin grooves; lyrics are thus rare and she soars above the irreprehensible top-notch instrumental backing with her trademark vocalizations of cries, whispers, whining and a basket full of rhythmical or ambient tricks, often double or multi tracked, at times soaked in delays or reverbs or with the occasional help of husband Airto Moreira on vocal harmonies.

   George Duke composed half the repertoire and was responsible for all the arrangements, his Funky touch permeating the set list as do the colorings provided by his keyboards arsenal, from inflamed moog solos (“Look into His Eyes”), to Funky Rhodes comping (“Juicy”) or ARP string ensemble sheets of sound (“That’s What She Said”), and he who often shaped his or others output into easy listening or even Muzak offerings did excel and created a fine body of work this time, in spite of Orrin Keepnews glossy production and its stylization and leveling effect which hampered the blossoming of a little more and welcomed aural diversity,

   Bass players Byron Miller and Alphonso Johnson propel the grooves by turns with their respective distinctive styles, the latter also responsible for the writing of “Love’s the Way I feel ‘bout Cha”, which coincidentally, or maybe not, evokes memories of Weather Report spacious/ethnic moods, and drummer Leon "Ndugu" Chancler drives the beat engine with his punchy colorful approach, besides  being responsible for the writing of the rhythmically tumultuous “Hidden Within” and the Latinized “You are My Heart”, the latter enriched with a tasteful Arp Odyssey synth solo by Hugo Fattoruso.

   Guitarists Jay Graydon and David T. Walker brought in their expertise and Funky chops on some tracks (though modestly used and somewhat drowned by the smoothing production), Airto besides contributing with all the rich percussive backing, lent his own “Flora on My Mind (rechristened  “You On My Mind” for the occasion and in the process losing some of the appeal it originally had on his Identity album from a couple of years earlier), and Joe Henderson contributes a short but blazing solo on “What Can I Say?” one of two tracks where the horns arrangements inject extra fuel on the infectious cadenzas.
