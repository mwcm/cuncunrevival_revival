   This Japanese CD collection brings together all the tracks from Philip Cohran's thrilling Zulu label 45s. While some of his and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble album tracks can be a bit sprawling, the limitations of the 7" format seems to have focused the Chicago jazz group's minds on creating some succinct but still impressive pieces. From the tribal Afro-jazz opener "The African Look", via the wickedly funky extended thumb-piano jam on "Loud Mouth" and Egyptian melodies on "El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz", the distillation of the AHE sound is absolutely fantastic.

   Another absolutely faultless offering from Philip Cohran and the Artistic Heritage Ensemble. As it clearly says, this is a compilation of all his singles, so some of them are available on the other two releases, but who cares, they're so bloody good I'm happy to have them twice. Of the new tracks, there's quite an element of funk developing to them, but still with all that Afro-centric magic you expect from these guys. Like the On the Beach album, this one is just so energising that you just walk away from it on a total high afterwards.

   As an aside, this album's release is probably due to one musically passionate RateYourMusic user contacting Mr. Cohran and politely bombarding him with requests to consider re-releasing these singles. So, if it wasn't for RYM and its music obsessed users, this release may never have seen the light of day.

   Enough talk, go out and buy this truly magical album, your life is incomplete without it.
