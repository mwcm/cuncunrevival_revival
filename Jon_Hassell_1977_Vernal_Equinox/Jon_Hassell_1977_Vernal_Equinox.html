   " Jon Hassell is more than a superb musician. He is an inventor of new forms of music - of new ideas of what music should be (...). [His] is an optimistic, global vision, which allows us to foresee not only 'possible music' but 'possible futures'” . Word of Brian Eno , who, after having "stolen" the idea of ​​the "Fourth-World Music" (a theft from which the acclaimed " My Life in the Bush of Ghosts " , created together with David Byrne, but which was originally conceived as a six-handed job) made him all the honors in an interview back in 1986. Those were the years when the great American trumpeter had by now reached an exemplary maturity, in terms not only artistic, but also human and "theoretical", in the wake of superb records, of which "Vernal Equinox" , the debut released by Lovely Music Ltd. in 1977, remains, to this day, the unsurpassed peak." (Pitchfork)
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But Hassell had reached that goal, certainly not in a painless way.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It has already been said of the question "theft", an event that deeply engraved on the psyche of Our, so much to induce him to a further meta-musical reflection, from which new fundamental works will come out, including "Fourth World Volume Two: Dream Theory in Malaya " (1981; in which the innovations of the masterpiece undergo a process of" radicalization ") and " Aka / Darbari / Java - Magic Realism " (1983; slightly less inspired, but still fascinating) .
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Born in 1937 in Memphis (Tennessee), the young Hassell grew amid a melting pot in miniature, invaghendosi early African-American music. his first love, Stan Kenton and Miles Davis . later, there was the shock - very common in those days - of the comparison with the works of Karlheinz Stockhausen (especially that of the historian " Gesang der Jünglinge "of 1956), whose courses he was able to attend in Cologne in 1965, shoulder to shoulder with Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt , later founding members of the Can . Hassell could have been part of the German band himself, but in accepting Schmidt's invitation he apologized, claiming that rock was not on his strings. He had other things on his mind and it soon became clear that when he returned home, he was able to participate in the recording sessions of " In C " (1967) by Terry Riley (or the "definitive" genesis of minimalism) and in some works by La Monte Young. In this way, he could prove to himself that he was more interested in overcoming (which, incidentally, will never be total) of certain Western-style musical conceptions. That his work should be a synthesis, he guessed after a trip to India, where he came into contact with the world of Indian music and with the indefinable nuances of the "ragas".
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Under the guidance of Pandit Pran Nath (great heir to the "Kirana" vocal tradition), in 1972 he began to study Indian chant, which exposed him to a "micro-world of connections". What strikes him is above all the aspect defined as "calligraphy in the air", connected with that almost supernatural ability that the Indians have to construct, with sounds, "forms" in space.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The first five months of lessons were exhausting. Teacher and student continually confronted each other, in a game of references and corrections, through a communication defined as "aural / oral". Pran Nath used to perform grueling vague ragas, exploring the characteristics of each note in such an obsessive way that it gave the listeners a true "trance" state.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Later, the master taught him to transfer that sound into the trumpet instrument. Hassell ended up making a sound very similar to what you get when you blow into a shell. It was something made of desert, of "psychic" resonances, in which the use of ragas (considered as a pre-verbal experience of knowledge) gave the possibility to merge in a new way the "spiritual" dimension and the "physical" dimension "Of Sound, also defining the boundaries of a space in which a state of grace exists. The latter is obtained through the abolition of divergences between North and South; that is: western civilization, full of materialism and rationalism, as well as heir to an incomplete musical tradition, because, unlike the eastern one (the South, in reference to the lower part of the human body,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The approach of the American musician towards the "Fourth World Music", however, also had a more "concrete" input, so to speak. His marriage ended badly, Hassell met a girl, the daughter of African-American and Native American parents; encounter that put him in contact with two distinct yet converging realities in a single body. The next step was the juxtaposition to the experiments of Miles Davis , whose " On the Corner "(1972) is considered by Our - rightly or wrongly - an album in which some characteristic elements of that synthesis that he was trying to implement are already contained in nuce. The reflection then shifted to the dichotomy between the "abstract" world of classical minimalism and that of shadows, of the elusive sensuality that lies behind the appearance of things. A first experiment in this direction was represented by the composition "Solid State"(1969), used as a "sound sculpture" in museums or art galleries. It is a "sound block" that is progressively eroded from the inside through the use of successive "distillations". In short: on the one hand a "structure" and on the other the "incessant movement". There are already some characteristic elements of ragas, such as, for example, the use of drones, or sound drones with hypnotic character. But to be honest, what was now pushing in the direction of "Vernal Equinox"were some fundamental precautions. First of all, drones become electronic, while percussions are clearly of Afro-Brazilian ancestry (and this is because Hassell was looking for something more "indefinable", compared to the more obvious use of an Indian "drumming"). The so-called "solo line" is missing, which, of course, was assigned to the trumpet and its electronic chiaroscuro (since its timbre was usually digitally altered). The "Fourth World Music" was so founded.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All this, however, would not have been possible without the help of another fundamental lesson. We refer to the "universalism" of Don Cherry, which is undoubtedly one of the cardinal moments in the journey towards a type of musical system built on the accumulation of increasingly dense and deeply "mystical" musical materials (see exemplary records such as "Mu" , " Relativity Suite " and the more electric " Brown Rice " ).
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   That said, it seems natural to see "Vernal Equinox"as a "monumental" work, precisely because of its ability to reflect, and, at the same time, incorporate different sources and experiences without distorting them. His greatness lies precisely in the fact of representing a "sound revelation", whose expressive and imaginative power perhaps not even the author himself managed to capture in the immediate of its realization and publication.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   For the universal fresco of his absolute masterpiece, Hassell called the Brazilian Naná Vasconcelos to percussion , the creator of an extremely ritualistic and evocative sound. Other types of percussion (acoustic and otherwise) were entrusted to David Rosenboom , Miguel Frasconi , Nicolas Kilbourn and William Winant. "Special guest" - so to speak ... - the "Night Creatures of Altamira", which with their distant and almost indistinct barks give the sound textures a deviant sense of "altered" mysticism. In addition to the "snake trumpet" (somehow indebted to Don Cherry's "expanded" style ), Hassell also deals with the "scenographic" aspect, so to speak, cared for through the discreet but perfectly suggestive use of a Fender Rhodes , whose sound is often transcended by the ecstatic trails of the Serge Synthesizer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The very first seconds of "Toucan Ocean" (3'56 ") already highlight the prodigious measure of things. A rhythmic wander of congas that slides into the breaking of the ocean on the shore. The choice is not random. As argued by Hassell, in fact, his music can be seen as a continuous swaying between opposite poles, a continuous entering and exiting an imaginary framework, in which - we add - the colors are the sounds and the lines the spiritual dimensions of the mind . The sinuous modulations of the trumpet evoke inner phantoms, in an empathetic soliloquy with that sick, turbid, humid timbre, which in turn brings together a meta-discourse on the immutability of music, rummaging through the folds of a concept very dear to La Monte Young, but that here becomes something else ... perhaps an image, most likely an ocean of sensations amid the wonders of a spring equinox.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In "Viva Shona" (7'08 "), instead, the trumpet coughs almost in fear, insecure. His dilated hisses space inside a mutant arabesque, built on the intertwining and dispersing of bells, mbira and tropical birds. Faithful to his musical vision, Hassell sees in these rituals of the spirit a no man's land in which the best "human" characteristics of different worlds meet in a "Possible World", generator of "Possible Music". But in this work of subtle purification, he also ends up chiselling a virgin space, in which the wild jungle meets the metaphorical one of the industrialized cities. Cities that, in their enormous growth, ended up completely submerging the sense of "origins". However, the latter ends, in one way or another, to return,The Residents , Pere Ubu , The Pop Group ) leaves deep traces even in the musical representations of a world on the verge of collapse. This is a perfect cultural equivalent of what is being done in "Vernal Equinox" .
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The music of Hassell, in fact, gives a little the feeling of a city that suddenly turns out to be naked, "primitive" beyond its technological shell, as eroded by a millennial wind, which comes from the most hidden parts of the Earth. They are the "unknowable aspects of the city" (to resume the title and "artistic intentions" of a historical piece by Joseph Jarman , on " Song For "), which suddenly come to the surface, mingling with the monstrous sonic babel of traffic, the chilling indifference of passers-by or the neon lights running down the glittering asphalt from the recently fallen rain. This conflict is sharpened in "Hex" (6'29 "), in the impossible embrace between Kilbourn's" talking drum ", the rattles of Vasconcelos and Rosenboom, on one side, and Hassell's sly and" shamanic "trumpet , on the other. It is incredible to see how the examples of techno / tribal impressionism that we will find in " Remain in Light " (think, for example, of "Seen And Not Seen") of the Talking Heads (with Eno in formation) are already widely defined and "accomplished."
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   However, that of the Memphis trumpeter is not a particular version of "world-music". Rather, his music is defined within the limits of a daring experimentalism in which the goal is the identification of a Universal Sound, capable of communicating emotions and visions that belong to the "sacred" roots (as rationally "unreachable") of the Land. But in the choice of technology as a coagulant factor, he states that in the refractions of those roots one also perceives "futurist" fluorescences, in a collision between past and future that manifests, in the state of grace reached, the unavoidable presence of existential distress, through the electronic coding of horror vacui (see, in this regard,
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   This is what appears even more evident in the next two pieces.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In "Blues Nile" (10'01 "), the distant torment of the trumpet, abandoned in the void, extends distances like rivers drained by the wind, while the sound erupts in a space / time diagram. The center of gravity of the piece - the static resonance of the Serge Synthesizer - twirls in an astral desert, made of dry anguish and atavistic silences. The feeling is that of a more "psychological" than musical stratification. In fact, in abandoning oneself to the uninterrupted flow of music, one ends up seeing particularly “sinister” echoes in the vibrating tremor of the synth, which digs around its borders, penetrating towards the center of its unraveling. The multifonia of the "snake trumpet" also reveals how the slipping inside of the notes takes place in an almost "impalpable" way, a bit like in the ragas, in which, with a careful listening, one can perceive an infinite change that contrasts with the apparent static nature of the musical surface. Thus we see an almost metaphysical connection between the real, pseudo-static, and the invisible forces that change it incessantly (it is no coincidence that Hassell maintained that "what is invisible is what surrounds us").
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Behind the placid embrace between percussion and the trumpet of the title track(22'07 "), there is still an unlimited space, in which electronics take on more" cosmic "connotations, while the curves of the trumpet mimic the sinuous body of a dancer buried by the sunset symphonic flood. In the unsolved confrontation between sensuality and structure, between ancient and modern, the enchanted ecstasy of a "pure" sound is generated, without geography and without masters. It is music made of infinitesimal accents, probably still largely incomprehensible, being dictated by a need too far in time: that of "music" the Soul (of the world and of man), but in such a way that the spaces between sound and silence be filled with a prodigious twilight whirring with hisses. In these 22 minutes of transcendental descriptivism, in which the trumpet touches heights and timbres of frightening lyricism, Hassell probably gives the maximum exposure of his great musical achievement. And it really seems, to paraphrase some of his statements, to be in the presence of perfect beauty in a perfect place. If there is, in short, a sound equivalent of the "Open" ofRilke , here you will find one of the most magical and "absolute" versions.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In "Caracas Night September 11, 1975" (2'12 ") we finally hear a hail of rattles and an insistent buzz of crickets, which slip to the edge of the night, while the trumpet declines to the September moon a poem made by now only of inscrutable evanescences.

   Recorded in 1976 at the York University Electronic Media Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Vernal Equinox is Jon Hassell's first recording as a solo artist and sets the stage for his then-emerging career as a trumpeter, composer and musical visionary. "Toucan Ocean" opens the album with two gently swaying chords and delicate layers of percussion that provide a cushion upon which Hassell unfurls long, winding melodic shapes. His trumpet is sent through echo and an envelope filter, producing a stereo auto-wah-wah effect. "Viva Shona" features accompaniment by mbira, subtle polyrhythmic layers of percussion, and the distant calling of birds. Again filtered through echo, Hassell's gliding trumpet lines sound remarkably vocal. "Hex" features a bubbling, filtered electric bass part with a denser web of percussion. From his horn, Hassell elicits moans and sighs that are at first unaffected and later filtered. "Blues Nile" is a long, blue moan. Hassell's breathy, multi-tracked trumpet lines call and respond to one another, weaving a web of deep calm over an ever-present drone. This track clearly points the way to his later work with Brian Eno, in particular, their "Charm Over Burundi Sky." On the title track, Hassell's "kirana" trumpet style is in full bloom as he dialogs with the percussion. Hassell's most elegant melodicism blossoms forth here, and his unaffected horn often sounds disarmingly flute-like. The influences of his study of raga with Pandit Pran Nath are clearly discernible in the curvaceous melodic lines and overall sense of meditative calm within harmonic stasis. Throughout the album, percussionists Naná Vasconcelos and David Rosenboom add subtle, supple grooves and colors. "Caracas Night September 11, 1975" is a beautiful field recording featuring Hassell's plaintive trumpet commentary, subtle percussion interjections, and the sound of caracas humming and buzzing in the background. The first several tracks of Vernal Equinox bear the imprint of '70s-period Miles Davis, in particular the quiet ambience of "He Loved Him Madly" and parallel passages from Agharta. The envelope filter on Hassell's horn similarly draws a reference to Davis' use of the wah-wah pedal from that time. Nonetheless, in 1976, Vernal Equinox was remarkably unique and ahead of its time, and sowed the seeds of Hassell's influential Fourth World aesthetic, which he would continue to develop and refine. Decades after its release, Vernal Equinox still provides an enchanting and entirely contemporary listening experience.
