   Some revolutionaries are born, others are made. Ornette Coleman is one of the former: he just seemed to hear music in a different way to anybody else - he probably hummed to himself when he was a toddler in an Ornettety Coleman sort of way, or maybe like Jimmy Stewart in The Glenn Miller Story he knew there was a sound out there that was his and as soon as he made it he knew that that was that. Eric Dolphy, however, was one of the latter: he moved slowly, each week, each month, each year was part of a progress, an adventure, that step by step led into new territories, the discovery of new sounds. And, as with John Coltrane, this was a voyage that only ended with his death. In a way he was a more radical musician than Coleman in that his music was always part of a process of change, of overturning what he had done up to that point. In the late summer of 1961 Dolphy set off for Europe with his alto, flute and bass clarinet in his bag and played music with whoever he could find. On this album, in early September, he was in Copenhagen and teamed up with a local rhythm section. But travel limits the horizons and the locals had little understanding of where Dolphy was voyaging, so the emphasis is on Dolphy, the band providing a rather conservative background. (Which isn't to dismiss the Danish musicians, they are competent - I like the drummer best - it's just that they are not working on the same level of imaginative engagement.) But then the band are only on two of the four tracks. One of the others - God Bless the Child - is a bass clarinet solo. I find the bass clarinet a strange instrument, its tone is as rich as polished oak, but then, at least as played by jazz musicians, it acts like an excited Jack Russell terrier rushing around and if you give it half a chance trying to mate with your leg. I can never make up my mind how successful Dolphy's God Bless the Child is: sometimes I find it enormously impressive, imaginatively spring boarding from the original material through idea after idea, but at other times I just find it showy, a mass of tics and mannerisms - it's probably somewhere in the middle, but I'm unsure where. My favourite number is Hi Fly, a duet - Dolphy on flute - with Chuck Israels on bass. (Israels just happened to be in Copenhagen so sat in for the tune.) But Israels also seems conservative compared to Dolphy: his solo is good natured and relaxed, but amiable compared to Dolphy's adventureness - and throughout he seems to act as Dolphy's soberly suited straight man. It's all worth hearing but there is nothing to match Aggression recorded at the Five Spot a couple of months earlier.
