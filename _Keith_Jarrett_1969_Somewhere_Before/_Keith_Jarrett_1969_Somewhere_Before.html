    The second of the three early Keith Jarrett Trio albums, this one recorded live at a Hollywood club in May 1968. And it is my least favourite of them. (Having fallen in love with 1970s Jarrett Quartet albums when I first discovered jazz, I now find these very early Jarrett Trio albums disappointing – I’m not sure how much that is because Jarrett was still passing through an apprenticeship and how much it is due to me, that I have heard a lot of Jarrett and what at first surprised and excited me now just seems old hat.) The music fails through a lack of integration – I don’t mean that the three musicians aren’t integrated, fail as a unit: all three are very fine and they seem to have had an understanding between them from their first meeting; the problem is that Jarrett’s eclectic range of styles and influences remain a series of different styles, different numbers trying different attitudes, as though Jarrett was putting on a new jacket for each tune. Over the past few years I have increasingly liked 1960s jazz that brings together a traditional sensibility and an avant garde shock: Jarrett does this – at least he draws on these two traditions (and it is convenient to say that Paul Motion brings with him his experience with Bill Evans, while Charlie Haden brings his time with Ornette Coleman), but the problem is that Jarrett doesn’t necessarily play them off each other, they remain separate: Pretty Ballad is his nod to Evans, the next number, Moving Soon, is his nod to Coleman, but they remain two different influences. The remarkable thing about his music over the next few years was the way all these elements became part of a Jarrettian aesthetic, a unique way of tackling and controlling all the influences (and this was also true for his first album Between the Exit Signs) – but there is a failure here. When you have three musicians this good there are bound to be many fine things, but the album seems a minor work, an apprentice piece, a step backwards when compared to his previous trio album – it’s nice enough, but there are many more Jarrett albums worth listening to.

    While still a member of the Charles Lloyd Quartet, Keith Jarrett did some occasional moonlighting with a trio, anchored by two future members of Jarrett's classic quartet, Charlie Haden (bass) and Paul Motian (drums). On this CD, Jarrett turns in a very eclectic set at Shelly's Manne-Hole in Hollywood, careening through a variety of idioms where his emerging individuality comes through in flashes. He covers Bob Dylan's "My Back Pages" -- which actually came out as a single on the Vortex label -- in an attractive, semi-funky style reminiscent of Vince Guaraldi. "Pretty Ballad" delivers a strong reflective dose of Bill Evans, while "Moving Soon" is chaotic free jazz. By the time we reach "New Rag," we begin to hear the distinctive Jarrett idiom of the later trios, but then, "Old Rag" is knockabout stride without the stride. As an example of early, unfocused Jarrett, this is fascinating material.
