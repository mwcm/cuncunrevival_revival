  This album is would appear to be the second release by The Ensemble Al-Salaam, as most of the players are present here, and the album is mainly led by Khaliq Abdul Al Rouf. The title track feels very similar too, in that deep righteous vocal jazz kind of way, but with a lot more funk thrown into the mix. The rest of the album is really quite mellow, or straight, late '70s jazz, and the tunes that are really quite mainstream, kind of seem unrelated to titles like "Malcolm, the Call". Mind you, I guess you could say that for any instrumental track. Like in Spinal Tap, where he plays the beautiful mellow guitar piece, then says it's called "Lick My Love Pump", or something along those lines. Nice overall effort, and the title track really does shine.
