   Following the death of her husband in '67, Alice Coltrane steadily recorded an album a year up until Transfiguration in 1978, a live session which consequently represents the culmination of her spiritual music via recordings and, for the most part, public appearances as well. After her first seven sessions through the late ‘60s and early '70s for Impulse!, Ms. Coltrane began recording for Warner in '75 around the time she founded a center for Eastern religious studies.

   The apex of that handful of sessions, Transfiguration features John Coltrane associates, bassist Reggie Workman (who appears on an earlier session, World Galaxy) and Roy Haynes on drums. "No finer people to let you feel what this force is really about," the leader matter of factly states in her introductions.

   The recording revisits many of her intense spiri-tual music sentiments via densely rhythmic, textural, and colorful modal work. Her Detroit church organist experience is on full display from the beginning. If she performed at this level in her church back in the '50s, it certainly would have appropriately foreshadowed perhaps the hippest of churches, the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church in San Francisco that speaks to a higher consciousness through the music and spirit of Trane himself. The title track finds the leader's modal morning-raga single notes complemented by Haynes' marvelous cymbal work and percussive chimes and bells, and Workman's appropriately moody arco bass. The three flow together with resonating bass plucks inciting snare and machine-gun drum rolls. Ms. Coltrane then hits a personal groove reminiscent of latter-day John Coltrane just over halfway into the piece with legato effects initiating a relentless Haynes' swing. Moving over to the acoustic piano for "One For The Father” (dedicated to John Coltrane), she beautifully performs an interesting twist on the spiri-tual "Go Down Moses". An entrancing and momentum -building nine-member string section, featuring the late violinist Noel Pointer, complements her harp treatment of the piano during another original, "Prema".

   The hymnal opening of the near 40-minute two-part "Leo" suite, in a blink, morphs into a bundle of sheer raw force. Relentlessly conjuring up meters and rhythms without hesitation, the trio collectively works to fill all potential spaces of rest. An unfortunately faded out unaccompanied bass solo (as was the case with the original vinyl) leads into the second part of "Leo" finding Haynes as nonpareil soloist. You can't help but wonder why he has gone unrecorded as an unaccompanied percussionist to this very day. As one of the living masters, Haynes has played in most possible surroundings with a who's-who of jazz histo-ry. Alice Coltrane reenters, her frenetic organ playing and sound sheets of momentum recalling Cecil Taylor and more recently guitarist Dom Minasi. Working the organ again like a harp in her hands, from top to bot-tom and not a key untouched or underutilized, the mountain of momentum naturally spills into the finale, washing ashore into thunderous applause.

   Alice Coltrane never had an easy time of it with critics. That she was able to pursue her rugged musical vision in the midst of controversy (many claimed she was "the Yoko Ono of the John Coltrane Quartet," in that she replaced McCoy Tyner when Trane decided to shift the focus of his band) is, in retrospect, a heroic act, though, humble as she is, she would never see it that way. This double-LP live set recorded at UCLA in 1978, reveals in total the ambitious and profound free jazz and universal musical frontiers Ms. Coltrane was able to explore in both small and larger groups. The lion's share of the music here features her in a trio setting with bassist Reggie Workman and drummer Roy Haynes. Ms. Coltrane performs on piano and organ. The opening moments of the title track, which opens the album, offer the careening subjectivity through the whole-tone improvisation that Alice Coltrane made her own. Certainly there is the influence of her late husband here, but her sense of phraseological articulation and accent is far different. She moves with one hand over a difficult series of arpeggiattic concerns, creating a strong harmonic line for Workman and Haynes to develop into a rhythmic construct. When a standard modal interlude develops in the rhythm section, Coltrane stretches it to its breaking point until a new one must be developed; it's nothing less than breathtaking. But expectation is thwarted when Coltrane plays a piano solo on "One for the Father," where the depth dynamics of Shostakovich meet the strident harmonic vistas of Stravinsky and Messiaen and engage the profound spiritual emotionalism of gospel music in a seven-minute piece that is so moving, it would seem that the set should end there. But there is so much more. On "Prema," another solo piano piece which opens an Eastern drone in a near-impressionistic (à la Debussy) manner was later overdubbed with a string section, adding more dimension to the droning, whole tones that lie at its root. When the work shifts into a section that reflects transcendence, the dynamic is actually quieter and more lush and reflective than in the music's searching passages. Finally, after two more selections, the concert's finale begins, a 37-minute read of John Coltrane's "Leo." Ms. Coltrane and her band begin slowly to articulate a system devised by John, where all 12 tones were related to the 12 signs of the zodiac. Alice Coltrane's organ soloing here is very much in the angular shifting, shaping, and contouring that her husband's soprano playing had. It articulates a phrase repeatedly until every ounce of emotion and spirit have been wrung from it and then dives straight into the next. The interplay between Workman and Haynes was so telepathic, it pushed Ms. Coltrane into new realms further inside these shimmering harmonics until their shards gave way to a series of symbols and meanings that opened onto new vistas in tonal metalinguistic post-tonalism. It's an exhausting work, but one that leaves the listener in a state of near disbelief at what just transpired. If you can only own one Alice Coltrane record, this should be it.
