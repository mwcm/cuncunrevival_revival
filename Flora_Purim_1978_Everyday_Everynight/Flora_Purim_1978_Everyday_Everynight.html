   Everyday, Everynight had escaped my record collection for unknown reasons. I always loved this album. Likely I lent it to someone who never bothered to return it. I made sure I found another copy.

   Upon listening to it again for the first time after more than twenty years, the memories, the nostalgia and the music brought tears to my eyes. And how was this album slandered by the Jazz press! Jazz? Of course, it's not Jazz. So what! Flora is from Brazil, and though this album was produced at high costs by Michel Colombier and clearly to chart in the US, the album is still very much a Brazilian affair. The sparkling all-star lineup - just to name the stars - Michael and Randy Brecker, Oscar Castro-Neves, Raul DeSouza, George Duke, Jon Faddis, David Foster, Jay Graydon, Lani Hall, Herbie Hancock, Alphonso Johnson, Harvey Mason, Byron Miller, Airto Moreira, Jaco Pastorius, Lee Ritenour, David Sanborn, Chester Thompson, Marcos Valle, and The London Symphony Orchestra Strings - and they do get a chance to contribute.

   Samba Michel, an exuberant Samba, and the dark Blues Ballad are the only two songs Flora sings in her native Portuguese. There's a mix of fast and slow tracks that keeps the level high throughout. Blues Ballad and the closing song Why I'm Alone are quite melancholy, they fuse the American Blues with the Brazilian Saudade.

   On this project, singer Flora Purim is backed by a large string orchestra and a countless number of top studio and jazz players, playing arrangements by Michel Colombier. Although some of the musicians are quite notable (including Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, David Sanborn, Oscar Neves, Jaco Pastorius and even Herbie Hancock), the overall music is generally forgettable. Most of the playing sounds planned in advance, and not much spontaneity occurs, certainly not from the London Symphony Orchestra. Purim's voice is fine, but none of the 11 songs (eight by Colombier) were destined to catch on.
