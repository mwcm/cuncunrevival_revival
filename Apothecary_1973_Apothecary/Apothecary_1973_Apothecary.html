   Apotecary sings the songs of you and me, claiming their lyrics from the shared experiences of millions of timeless men, picking at your brain with easy lyrics, poking a hole in your soul with their melodies. And as "Minstrels of the Common Man,"nthey ask only that "I think of you and you think of me."

   I've seen this one posted on several blogs, always with one track cut and one missing, and more than once it has been requested over here. So I called my Cuban connection in Florida, and yes sir!. He had a mint copy of the album. Yesterday night he made me a lossless rip and here it is for your Thanksgiving Day enjoyment. All thanks to Guery my musical soul brother!

    I know next to nothing about this band and their background, so I hope someone can add some background info about these guys for our enlightenment.

   All I can say is that I absolutely love this one. It's pretty good, melodic rock. Not really psychedelic, progressive, rural-country but just good melodic rock music. About half of it is acoustic based but not in a finger-picking or solo guy strumming way. Instead the acoustic guitars are piled up on top of each other to make them quiet driving. As far as albums released by Paramount this is at the top as best on the label in my collection.
