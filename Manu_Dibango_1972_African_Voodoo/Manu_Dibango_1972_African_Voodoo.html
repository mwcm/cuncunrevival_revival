   An amazing rare chapter in the career of the legendary Manu Dibango – and a darn funky one as well! This early 70s album was recorded in Paris, right before Manu's huge global "Soul Makossa" hit – and although it was done as an obscure sound library release, it really shows Dibango jumping into all the best funky modes that would soon make him a giant! In face, the whole thing might well be Manu's funkiest record ever – as the tracks have no vocals, and are tight and right on the money – with plenty of heavy drums and massive basslines – plus instrumentation from a very cool lineup of French jazz players that includes Yvan Julien on trumpet and Francois Jenneau on tenor. Manu himself blows lots of funky flute and sax solos – and also plays vibes, piano, and organ – on very groovy instrumentals that include "Iron Wood", "Coconut", "Zoom 20

   These files were recorded in 1971 at Pathé-Marconi studio (Boulogne Billancourt) for professional sound illustration intended for the cinema, television and advertising. The jazzman experimenting with all genres was then beginning to convert solely to what soon to be called “Rare Groove” somewhere between Soul, Jazz and Afro-Funk, with a hint of Latin clave.

   In 2019, these tunes have not aged and the sound can be considered as “Huge” by many crate-diggers. These recordings were not supposed to reach the club or radio audience, it was more free sessions, a moment during they can open their imagination and test their “Afro something”, like Manu Dibango call it. Theses recording sessions included the best of the french soul scene at this time, Yvan Julien (Trumpet), Slim Pezin (Guitar), Jacques Bolognesi (Trombone), Lucien Dobat (Drums), Emile Boza (Percussions, Manfred (Bass) and the conductor himself at the vibraphone, marimba, saxophone, organ ...

   This album is a wonderful return to the future and should satisfy the need of the Afro-Soul aficionados! We're very happy to celebrate the 86th anniversary of the best French musician in history with one of his best recording reissue!
