   In September 1974 with the self titled debut still flying high in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic Bad Company took some time out from their extensive touring schedule and moved into Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire to begin work on their second album 'Straight Shooter'. A haunted castle which had already in the previous twelve months hosted Deep Purple among others it was the ideal venue to follow on from the previous years adventures at Headley Grange. With the Ronnie Lane Mobile and engineer Ron Nevison all set up Bad Company duly arrived with a batch of powerful songs, some of which had already featured in the live set.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The main difference between 'Straight Shooter' and the debut album is that the sound has definitely moved more towards the stadium/arena rock sound and away from the lingering Free influences which were evident on that debut.

   Opening cut and first single 'Good Lovin Gone Bad' is possibly the heaviest and most powerful track the band ever recorded. Like the previous years 'Can't Get Enough' it was written by guitarist Mick Ralphs but the sound here is far more air guitar heavy rock than the bluesy strutting songs on the first album. In contrast the following track, and coincidentally following single 'Feel Like Makin Love' is a much lighter affair although it builds to a quite heavy climax. The song has been recorded by several other artists including Pauline Henry and has featured in many TV shows and films. It has become as synonymous with Bad Company as 'Can't Get Enough' as is played constantly on the radio on both sides of the Atlantic, therefore it needs no in depth analysis from me !

   'Shooting Star' though is probably the best cut on the album and remains an integral part of any Bad Company or Paul Rodgers show to this very day. Telling the story of a young man embarking on his rock n roll adventure, hitting the bigtime and subsequently dying of substance abuse it has wrongly been credited as a tribute to several fallen rockers including Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and more obviously Paul Kossoff. Rodgers though has always denied that it was written with one particular person in mind and suggests it is more of a  warning of the pitfalls of the rock n roll lifestyle.

   Another song that was in the live set before being recorded was 'Deal With The Preacher'. A belting rock song with a nice bridge it was an ideal concert opener and none of the power was lost on the studio version. It ensured both sides of the original vinyl issue opened with a bang. It remains one of my favourite Bad Company tracks. Early live versions had slightly different lyrics and although none of these are commercially available there are a few knocking around on bootlegs. Similarly 'Wild Fire Woman' was to become a live favourite in the early years with its driving rhythm ideally suited for US radio. The album also includes two Simon Kirke penned tunes. The country tinged pair 'Weep No More' which features a nice string arrangement from Jimmy Horowitz and 'Anna' which was a reworking of a song originally recorded for the Kossoff Kirke Tetsu &amp; Rabbit album some three years earlier. Obviously with Rodgers handling the vocal this time around, Kirke had sung it himself on the earlier recording, this is by far the superior version. The album closes with the lengthy 'Call On Me' a bluesy lightweight meander which really doesn't go anywhere and is probably the albums weakest cut.

   The track 'Whisky Bottle' was also recorded at these sessions and was used as the B-side to 'Good Lovin Gone Bad. It is now available on The Original Bad Company Anthology.

   Like its predecessor 'Straight Shooter' rode high in the upper echelons the album chart on its release in April 1975 peaking at #3 on both sides of the Atlantic jettisoning Bad Company into a seemingly never ending world of stadium sized headlining tours of America and all the excesses that accompanied it.
