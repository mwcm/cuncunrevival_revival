   For this set, trombonist Roswell Rudd (who doubles on French horn) heads a quintet that also includes pianist Hod O'Brien, bassist Arild Anderson, drummer Barry Altschul and, most interestingly, singer Sheila Jordan. The repertoire includes "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life," Herbie Hancock's "Maiden Voyage" and a few originals, including three Rudd tunes that are played as a medley. The trombonist plays quite well; the rhythm section is tight yet adventurous; and the use of Jordan (who also has some individual spots) as part of some of the ensembles helps make the date something special. Recommended.

   Roswell Rudd's Impulse release of "Everywhere" is sill my favorite solo, but other than the remarkable percussion of Beaver Harris, the "free counterpoint" otherwise known as collective free jazz and other recordings with Archie Shepp, do not appeal to me. His various combos with Steve Lacy have proved problematic for me, because besides needing MORE COWBELL, I am looking for MORE RUDD.

   Perhaps the most sympathetic combo I have heard Rudd perform in is the legendary NRBQ (or at least part of it) and the band outings with Carla Bley and Charlie Haden are quite satisfying. The collective combos of the past seem more dedicated to saying something "important" than something that is entertaining; there is nothing wrong with fun in music, and Rudd knows how to do that. He also knows how to SWING, and his vocals show off that sometimes politically incorrect component, and these do remind me somewhat of Jack Teagarden. Only Ray Anderson these days tries to wear both hats, but Anderson's singing does not inspire me, and it is a technical achievement to take the trombone into saxophone territory, as Anderson does, but the sound of the instrument suffers, in my opinion.

   In this setting, we get to hear Sheila Jordan doing the Legrand standard "What are you doing the rest of your life?" with Rudd accompanying on trombone, no mean feat. The simple effect of terracing the sound by entrance and exit of the participants is far more satisfying than the jarring collective contributions on other recordings.

   Rudd also plays French Horn to great effect, but his tribute suite with his improvised ballad is the high point of this recording for me. His use of the entire instrument (horns and hooves) is a thousand miles from the approach of J J, Urbie Green or Jack Teagarden, but if you remember Dickie Wells, Kai Winding, or Bill Harris, there was a place for sheer sonic adventure with this instrument. I lived in the world of the trombone for over 20 years and coming from a background of JJ and Urbie, I found Rudd tough sledding at first, but he gradually became my overall favorite.
