   Issued as part of Mosaic Records' Singles series, Hard Bop is given the deluxe treatment here. For starters, this 1957 date -- with altoist Jackie McLean, pianist Sam Dockery, trumpeter Bill Hardman, and bassist Spanky DeBrest -- appears here for the first time in stereo, remastered from the original three-track tapes. Another plus is the addition of four tracks from the same sessions, recorded September 12 and 13, 1956, at Columbia Studios. The original featured McLean's classic "Little Melonae," as well as the steaming Hardman number "Cranky Spanky" and one he wrote with McLean, "Stanley's Stiff Chickens," all of which are fine definitions of what hard bop indeed was. The bonuses here include three tracks from Drum Suite -- including Gigi Gryce's "Nica's Tempo," Hardman's "Just for Marty," and Mal Waldron's stunner "Dee's Dilemma." It's topped off with "Gershwin Medley" from Originally, released by Columbia in 1981. This is the first place this entire session in all its finery has been assembled. While it's true this was the band right after Horace Silver left, and was still not in its most memorable era, the music here is for the most part flawless and necessary for any Jazz Messengers fan

   The following brief review was intended for the original "Hard Bop" on a 1956 Columbia date. The present "Hard Bop" is an anthology of essential Blakey recordings that can be easily recommended, though for some it might be preferable to go to the individual albums. For example, several of the tracks are from the indispensable "A Night at Birdland," an early (1954) Messengers' album and one of the first Blue Note "live" albums. It's revered by many collectors as representative of some of the best of Clifford Brown and originally was released as two separate vinyl volumes. (Give the nod to Vol. 1.)]
