   This Philly native had been touring with Charles Earland as a teen before joining up with Ornette Coleman's Prime Time,the saxophonist's foray into funk. It would be these years that would have the most enormous effect of Tacuma's playing. He became known as an excellent performer with a keen fashion sense,as well as a style of bass playing that was in fact rather unique in terms of it's fire and intensity. Recording as a band leader was only a matter of time. And the best thing for his career was that this was the result of that possibility.

   Recorded with relatively small groups of musicians this albums gets off to an amazing start with "Sunk In The Funk",probably some of the most high octane,polyrhythmic and sonically breathtaking harmolodic funk this side of Miles Davis' early 70's work. And Ornette was probably proud as well. "Rhythm Box" is another powerful groove,this time taking on a probing sort of Caribbean/reggae rhythm. "Animated Creation" is another slice of rhythmic funk music power built around Tacuma's high octane bass playing. These faster numbers are counter measured by the soft,balladic and pretty melodies of "From Me To You" and "The Bird Of Paradise". All of these numbers feature the trio of Tacuma,pianist Anthony David and Ann Sullivan on harp with a string quartet.

   The title song is musical absolutely amazing. It's funky,it swings,it's plainly melodic and somehow harmelodic as well. Everything just expands on itself with the addition of the horns to penetrate the ear further. On "Tacuma Song" he just takes on the solo bass and we see without any accompaniment just what this man can do. The last two numbers "From The Land Of The Sand" and the closer "Sophisticated Us",featuring another Tacuma associated James Blood Ulmer on guitar are both intense polyrhythmic jazz-funkers and the more abstract numbers here. Whatever type of funk groove it is-hard,soft or arty Jamaaladeen Tacuma manages to bring it into his orbit somehow. It's totally flamboyant,engaging,exciting and a lot of fun. Even with all the intense musical energy put into it,the result is joyful to experience for the jazz and funk lover.
