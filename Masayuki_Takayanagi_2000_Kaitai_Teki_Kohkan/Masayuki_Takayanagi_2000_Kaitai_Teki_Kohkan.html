  Masayuki 'Jojo' Takayanagi (1932 - 1991) was a Japanese jazz / free improvisational musician. He was active in the Japanese jazz scene from the late 1950s. In the 1960s he formed New Directions, which recorded four albums; Independence (1970), New Direction - Call In Question (1970), Free Form Suite (1977), and Lonely Woman (1982). He has also recorded several albums with saxophonist Kaoru Abe, including Gradually Projection and Mass Projection.

  Kaoru Abe (May 3, 1949 - September 9, 1978) was a Japanese free jazz alto saxophonist, who generally played solo. He died young from a drug overdose, and has been romanticized in the Japanese jazz underground. He was married to the author Izumi Suzuki, and was the subject of the film Endless Waltz by the director Koji Wakamatsu. Collaborators included Masayuki Takayanagi, Derek Bailey, Sabu Toyozumi, Aquirax Aida, and Motoharu Yoshizawa. Those said to have been influenced by Abe include Otomo Yoshihide and Masayoshi Urabe. He was cousin with the famous singer Kyu Sakamoto. Â (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoru_Abe)

  This recording dating from 1970 is duo free improvisation from two of the Japanese avant-garde music scene's most vital practitioners. Both have since passed on and left some of the most challenging music in the world of post- jazz improvisation. It has been said that this duo are like the Tokyo equivalent of Derek Bailey and Evan Parker and it is easy to see why. Some the New Direction Unit recordings of the '60 predate noise and free improvised music of the following decades in that they deployment of feedback-guitar and noise are frankly shocking when we consider the culture and the era in which these were produced. Fans of the extreme end of improvised music -- be it Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brotzmann, or Borbetomagus should give at least an hour of your attention to this incredible recording -- this could only be matched by the singular music of Cecil Taylor for total outward-bound energy. Exceptional recording fidelity and production on the Japanese D.I.W label, this is a must for collectors of free jazz and Japanese noise alike.
