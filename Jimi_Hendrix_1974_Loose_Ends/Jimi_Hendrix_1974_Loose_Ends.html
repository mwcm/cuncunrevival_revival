   A collection of outtakes and jams recorded between 1967 and 1970, with the exception of track 4 which is the sole authorized by Hendrix, in a new stereo mix by Eddie Kramer.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   All have been subsequently re-released on other official albums, in some form, except track 2.

   Mostly outtakes and loose jams with one authorized track that came out in Jimi's lifetime (The Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice), the outstanding track on this for me is "Drifter's Escape". I prefer the mix on this lp rather than the one on the Jimi Hendrix Experience box set. I think it's a tighter mix, and the fuzz guitar part at the end was just striking the way it came to an abrupt end (much like Jimi's too short life), and on the box set it gets marred by Billy Cox's bass.

   Michael Jeffrey, who was Jimi's manager during his life, was still able to put out product to make money off of Jimi's name. Considered by some to be an awful release, it was only put out in the U.K. in February, 1974 on the Polydor label because Warner Bros. (who were Jimi's record company at the time) refused to release it in the U.S &amp; Canada, saying it was of inferior quality. This was the last Michael Jeffrey release.
