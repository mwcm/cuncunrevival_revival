   206. Blueberry Hill
   <br/>
   <br/>
   STEREO MATRIX of 4 audience recordings synchronized &amp; mixed together in varying levels:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Source #1 = Neutral Zone bootleg CDs [the Blimp Records / TMOQ recording].
   <br/>
   Source #2 = Rubber Dubber Records bootleg LP.
   <br/>
   Source #3 = tape source [of Mud Dogs bootleg].
   <br/>
   Source #5 = tape source [of Tarantura (2000) bootleg].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     The lesser fidelity tape sources #4 [a/k/a Tarantura (1997)] and #6 (the most recently surfaced one) have been used to patch the introduction which is almost wholly missing from the other circulating tapes. See the Note further below for more information and identification, to the best of our ability and recollection
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #1 = the classic TMOQ / Blimp Records bootleg recording (by "Dub" Taylor, Sennheiser 805 shotgun mic &gt; Uher 4000 reel-to-reel?) via the Neutral Zone CDs [NZCD-89019/20, songs re-ordered, from vinyl cutting master?].
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Small sections flown in from an Empress Valley bootleg CD box [EVSD-385/6] which is somewhat more complete, even after its composite-patches from other sources have been eliminated. Nevertheless, over 5 minutes of "Moby Dick" (and 16 seconds afterwards) and nearly 2 minutes following "Communication Breakdown" are still missing. The recording also has a small splice in "Dazed and Confused", plus 13 and 10 second cuts after it and "WISASNB", respectively.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #2 = the original Rubber Dubber Records bootleg recording (by Scott Johnson) via vinyl LP transfer [dadgad]; incomplete and in the wrong order on the LP, missing mainly the first three songs and the two encores, "Moby Dick", nearly 6 minutes of the "Whole Lotta Love" medley (all marked with * above) and 2 minutes of the intro to "Bron-Yr-Aur". The original tapes have never surfaced and were reportedly lost when the bootlegger was busted, but the available recording is of rather excellent quality for its time and has been used to good effect to augment the sound of the tracks for which it exists.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #3 = taken from a transfer of a 2nd gen. reel [Doinker; EVSD calls this recording "TMOQ Alternate Source"]. Retains fragments of the concert introduction but is missing some 1:45 of the intro &amp; tuning before "Bron-Yr-Aur", most of the "Organ Solo" (just after "SIBLY" ends; 2 seconds is also cut in the applause afterwards), about 12½ minutes of "Moby Dick", and about 45 seconds after both "Whole Lotta Love" and "Communication Breakdown". In addition, 3 seconds is cut in "Dazed" along with 5 and 12 seconds during the introductions to "That's the Way" and "WIAWSNB", respectively. Used in somewhat lesser degree than sources #1 &amp; #5, which are arguably superior sounding.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #4 = used for the concert intro only, taken from Wendy bootleg CD box (discs 7-8) [WECD-285/6; EVSD calls this "Antrabata Source"]. This recording contains the complete introduction but has poorer sound than the other sources, except the last.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #5 = taken from a DAT transfer of a 2nd gen. cassette [javit/dadgad; EVSD calls this "Cobra Source"]. A relatively unscathed recording as it circulates, with just the bulk of "Bron-Yr-Aur" and 45 seconds prior to "Whole Lotta Love" (including the first bars) missing, presumably at tape changes; also has a small cut in "Dazed" and omits 2 seconds after "Whole Lotta Love". Has more tape available after the show ends (along with the EVSD version of #1). Blends well with source #1 so that together they reduce the shortcomings of each other.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Source #6 = taken from a transfer of the master cassette (ext. mic in taper's t-shirt to Craig Portable Cassette Recorder). The last source to surface, made available by the original taper. Like #4, captures the complete concert intro but the sound quality is a notch below even that tape.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     All six recordings were necessary in making this matrix. Surprisingly, it turned out to be feasible to utilize in some fashion all the four major sources, as far as they are available; as mentioned, the two lesser fidelity sources have been used just for the introduction. (Note that the numbering of sources #4 &amp; #5 is sometimes reversed compared to the preceding.)
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     <br/>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     The exact details are too complex to be written out but the workflow was to first manually yet accurately synchronize -- and where necessary, patch and re-arrange -- the recordings in digital realm with high quality varispeed resampling, resulting in a sort of quasi-multitrack/mic recording. Some audio restoration work was then done on each and the general mix for level and stereo balance was arrived at after trial, error, and experimentation, accounting for any gaps in the tapes. Further work was then required to fine-tune the transition points (at tape breaks), the relative levels and EQ until the end result seemed to be reasonably close to what can be achieved, without too obviously audible artifacts resulting from the mixing together a bunch of half a century old analogue recordings, which cannot be completely brought into exact phase and sync.

     This is the big one, the tape that started it all. The lives of Led Zeppelin fans would never be the same after this recording made its way into their collective hands.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     There are not many live Led Zeppelin shows available to purchase officially. For a band as important as Led Zeppelin, it’s very surprising that Atlantic Records, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant have not released more live shows to their fans. For years, all we had was the soundtrack to the motion picture The Song Remains the Same. It is only within the past twenty years that the vaults have opened just a bit with the release of The BBC Sessions , How The West Was Won and the bonus live CD on the remastered Led Zeppelin One album. Still, three official live albums of the original four members of Zep is very limiting for a band that many feel was the greatest rock and roll band to ever grace the stage.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Like all legendary classic rock artists, Led Zeppelin has always been a group that has been widely bootlegged. Most of the Led Zeppelin bootlegs that collectors have traded, shared and sold are audience recordings. For years there were only a handful of soundboards. The 1977 Soundboard that was released under the title Destroyer was usually thought of as the best Led Zeppelin bootleg ever released.  (Until Empress Valley graced our collection with the still going on strong stream of soundboards from 1975/1977... Viva La Soundboard Revolution!) Nonetheless, there are some audience recordings from the late 1960s and early 1970s that define the brilliant musicianship and passion of the band wonderfully. The bootleg Live on Blueberry Hill is one such recording that showcased a band that was looking to prove just how great they were. They succeeded immensely on this one.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Live On Blueberry Hill is so fabulous because of the performances by all four members on that September 4, 1970 night at the Los Angeles Forum. The heart of a great Led Zeppelin performance was always led by the great Jimmy Page. If Page was on, Led Zeppelin was on. These guys listened to each other. All musicians have great nights and so so nights. That September 4th night in L.A. was a night in which Page was in complete tune and his solos were clean and exciting. Page solos right away as the night began in the opening number “The Immigrant Song.” However it’s in the set’s second song “Heartbreaker,” when Page lights it up with a solo in the middle of the song that stands as one of his best live performances of all time.

     The LED ZEPPELIN is taking off as well, not to mention flying high. Their concert at the Forum, near Hollywood, was a complete sell out. Robert Plant was especially fantastic on *Immigrant Song*, JIMMY PAGE was ear-shattering on guitar and JOHN PAUL JONES really got it on. The best number, actually, was the finale, *Whole Lotta Love*, because bits of other rock songs were interspersed, and the audience really flippped. Drummer JOHN BONHAM did his thing on this last one, and didn't we love it! And them. You must loan them to us more often.

     Led Zeppelin Plays for Forum Audience
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     By John Mendelsohn. Los Angeles Times (Sept. 7, 1970).
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Musically reactionary, overbearing, plagiaristic and exploitative. Though these adjectives may remain occasionally applicable, they no longer suffice in summing up Led Zeppelin, as was quite lucid at the group's Friday evening performance at the Forum.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     To rest one's case after simply cataloging the group's musical deficiencies is first to wither in the face of responsibility of explaining its awesome commercial success (which is indicated by the fact that the current one is the second consecutive American tour in the last five months during which the group has played to capacity audiences in Forum-proportioned venues).
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     This success may be attributable at least in part to the accelerating popularity among the teen-age rock and roll audience of barbiturates and amphetamines, drugs that render their users most responsive to crushing volume and ferocious histrionics of the sort Zeppelin has heretofore dealt in exclusivity.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Combine this condition of the audience with Jimmy Page's veneration as a super-guitarist and Robert Plant's ability to brilliantly caricaturize the archetypal sexy lead singer and shatter bottles at 40 paces with his shrieking and it's not at all difficult to see how the group has achieved astonishing success.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     A contextual consideration is also in order. The advent of such practitioners in roughly the same as Mountain and Grand Funk, which picked up where Zeppelin left off in sacrificing everything possible to volume and histrionics, has had the effect of making Zeppelin look terrific in comparison.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     "Whole Lotta Love," for instance, strikes ears that have survived Mark Farner and Black Sabbath as a masterpiece of subtlety. Which is not to imply that many of Zeppelin's ridiculously overblown heavy workouts aren't enormous absurd fun on their own, for they are.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Finally, it must be mentioned that, apparently a trifle bored with being enormous fun, Zeppelin has taken to slipping quiet and definitely musical bits in between its dreaded screamers, bits like a pleasant (if far from dazzling) organ interlude by John Paul Jones.

     At the L.A. show, Robert Plant’s vocals sound like he was in the studio. Plant hits every note in perfect tune. Robert Plant’s resonance is incredibly deep and strong. Robert Plant’s performance in “Dazed and Confused,” is to die for. Plant pulls out snippets of classic tunes like “Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay,” and scats perfectly with Jimmy Page through the middle instrumental break.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     The performance of “Since I’ve Been Loving You,” will always stand as one of the highlights of that 1970 L.A. Forum show. Jimmy Page opens with that crying solo just before Robert Plant starts to sing low and deep. After the first verse, Robert Plant breaks into his higher register on the line “Everybody tells me.” and then lets it loose like no other rock and roll singer in history. Robert Plant finishes the line and Jimmy Page breaks into an immaculate solo that will leave you crying. It’s unbelievable how great these guys were. When Jimmy Page finishes his solo. Robert Plant returns with the line, “I said I’ve been crying,” singing the highest notes I have ever heard the man sing. It’s downright scary that a human can sing like that. It’s why Robert Plant was always thought of as the ultimate Rock God.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are not the only members of Led Zeppelin that had their brilliant solo moments. John Paul Jones takes center stage on his celtic inspired organ solo just before the performance of “Thank You.” John Bonham’ shines basically on every song. A Led Zeppelin show would not have been a Led Zeppelin show without a performance of “Moby Dick.”The song always gave Bonham his turn under the solo spotlight.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
     In the end, the band’s fiery and virtuoso performances were the ultimate reason why the L.A..Forums shows were one of the highlights of Led Zeppelin’s career. Furthermore, what made these shows even more special were the cover songs that Led Zeppelin performed. The bootleg Live On Blueberry Hill gets its name from the Led Zeppelin encore performance of the song “Blueberry Hill.” At first, fans may shake their heads wondering over the song choice, but anyone who has listened to interviews with Robert Plant would understand the lead singer’s love of the blues. Robert Plant has always been a fan of that music and Led Zeppelin has always been in essence a blues band. Interestingly, four years later at the LA Forum, all four members attended an Elvis Presley concert. They all went backstage and hung out with Elvis for a couple of hours talking about those same blues influences that they all shared.

     Live On Blueberry Hill is the cornerstone of Led Zeppelin’s bootleg discography. The original bootleg was released soon after the show and has been in “print” in one form or another for the past 49 years. What is even more amazing is the number of recordings from that famous night in September 1970 at the LA Forum, a total of six audience recordings are in existence, a staggering number, but goes to show the popularity of the band as well as their reputation as a live act.

     The Sixth American tour in late summer 1970 is an easy favorite for those who listen to the audience sources. The performances on a whole are staggering, thrilling to the masses with visceral performances and like many, this concert was my first 1970 live tape and I wore it out. Typical for many of Led Zeppelin’s tours, the band gave standout performances in LA, Oakland (San Francisco Bay Area), and New York City where they played rare songs like Out On The tiles, Train Kept A Rollin’ and the Fats Domino classic Blueberry Hill. Many reviews of this famous concert have been written, describing the action and level of performance so you already know this is a superb concert and extremely well recorded. Moonchild's mix of the tapes to provide the full concert is well done and after several listens, I could not find a blemish and have presented a really nice version of this concert.
