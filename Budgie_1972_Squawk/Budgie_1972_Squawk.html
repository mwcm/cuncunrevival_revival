  The second longplayer from the Welsh vintage heavy trio shows their power most best along with their third album. THere are some really ace smashers on the album like opener "Whiskey River" and "Hot as A Docker's Armpit", proving that their lyrics are silly but that bluesy distorted amplified acoustic guitar and double bass drum treatments give a good ride if your open to their sound and style. From these tracks search for the John Peel session versions, if you are not allergic to lofi sounds. The album has in the style of other early records of this band few shorter acoustic ballads, "Make Me Happy" being quite pleasant open to the following groovy heavy rock tune. "Rocking Man" and "Drugstore Woman" are quite decent rockers, but not as interesting as the other tracks. The favourite track here for me in adition of the heavier tracks is the long and romantic "Young is A World". The only flaw here is the quite poor lyrics, which sound that they could have been improvised during the performing. Anyway, the composition is pretty melodic minor piece with good structures, room for free playing. The album closer is also a nice menacing heavy rock piece, and the here and there played mellotrons do not make the record any worst. If you like the bluesy groove sligthly similar than in the first album of Black Sabbath, or the hard smashing of very early Rush records, check this one out.
