   Fake applause comes in as the notorious Armand Schaubroeck's eternally distraught vocal cuts through with the autobiographical "Elmira Bound." The liner notes give the details of his "going away" to the Elmra Reformatory -- "Armand Schaubroeck was sentenced to three years in Elmira Reformatory, a maximum security prison on February 21, 1962 for a safecracking charge." This is great rock &amp; roll with a groove, claimed to be recorded live "at the Holiday Inn, Downtown Rochester New York." With what sounds like canned applause it could very well have been recorded in the back room of Mirror Records at Schaubroeck's House of Guitars in Titus, New York -- -or on-stage at the prison. "Ex-Con" continues the saga with solid guitar playing and rhythmic backing vocals. Schaubroeck rants...and rants...and rants, but his ranting and his expression are more adventurous and interesting than a lot of stuff the major labels were pushing on the public in the late '70s. The album's four sides are strangely on different speeds, one and two are 33 1/3 while sides 3 and 4 are at 45 rpm. Most companies release 15 minutes per side, but with "Streetwalker" clocking in at 20:30, it was appropriate to log Schaubroeck's vision properly and not put part two of this on a separate disc. The added applause really becomes annoying on "King of the Streets," but that's part of Schaubroeck's vision as well. Where Ratfucker is a consistent and focused masterpiece, this -- like a good live performance -- has its own life outside of the studio tracks where some of this material originally found the light of day. "Goddamn You" boasts a terrific rock band, but enough is enough. Nine minutes and thirty seconds of it is a bit much. On second thought, this could have all fit on a single LP, but excess was part of what Armand Schaubroeck was all about at this point in time. It is interesting in its calculation, and the shame of it is that the dude has a lot of talent. What Schaubroeck needed was a record producer who understood him, and perhaps, that is a tall order. Frank Zappa might have been able to make something commercial out of all this. Despite the flaws, Live at the Holiday Inn is more entertaining than you might think.
