   This album is a George Duke production. George Duke was one of Flora Purim's comrade-in-arms from her debut record, but it must have been this experience in particular which inspired the man to record his own A Brazilian Love Affair some months later. Again, he assembled the creme de la creme of Californian studio musicians: Ronnie Foster, Greg Phillinganes, Mike Sembello, Sheila Escovedo, Joe Farrell from NYC, Larry Williams, Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, etc. and his regular band.

   Carry On, a Disco track, has some nice improvisations from Flora and Al Jarreau. I also still like the pensive Once I Ran Away, Sarara written by Gilberto Gil and especially the Toninho Horta song, Beijo Partido (Broken Kiss) both sung in Portuguese.

   Carry On was Flora Purim's final record in the seventies. When one recalls her 70s output, it was kind of erratic, but it's fair to conclude that she contributed some of the most adventurous vocal Jazz of that decade.

   In 1979, jazz was no longer George Duke's primary focus; his albums were emphasizing soul/funk, and many of the R&amp;B fans who knew him for late '70s hits, like "Dukey Stick,""I Want You for Myself," and "Reach for It," knew little or nothing about his work with Cannonball Adderley, Billy Cobham, or Jean-Luc Ponty. But Duke was still producing some jazz albums here and there, although they weren't necessarily straight ahead. Even though Flora Purim's Carry On, which Duke produced, is primarily a Brazilian jazz album, it isn't for jazz purists -- rather, Purim provides an eclectic blend of jazz, samba, R&amp;B/funk, rock, and pop. Purim has many inspired moments on this LP and is joined by members of Duke's late '70s band -- bassist Byron Miller, drummers Ricky Lawson and Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, percussionist Sheila Escovedo (who became Sheila E after joining forces with Prince in 1984), keyboardist Bobby Lyle, trumpeter Jerry Hey, and saxman Joe Farrell. In addition to excelling on Duke's funky title song, Gilberto Gil's "Sarara," and Toninho Horta's "Beijo Partido," Purim really lets loose on Milton Nascimento's "From the Lonely Afternoon." Those who associate "From the Lonely Afternoon" with Wayne Shorter's superb Native Dancer album will find Purim's interpretation to be faster and more intense.
