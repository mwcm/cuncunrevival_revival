  This monumental album, perhaps as important as fellow Polish Jazz Godfather Krzysztof Komeda's "Astigmantic", recorded at the same period, is unfortunately significantly less known and appreciated, both in Poland and abroad, which is a great misfortune. Pianist / composer Andrzej Trzaskowski contributed enormously to the development of Polish Jazz, especially in the field of more experimental, avant-garde, Free Jazz music, which was rapidly developing worldwide in the 1960s. This sextet recording, which includes American trumpeter Ted Curson (of Charles Mingus fame), who was spending as much of his time in Europe as at home, playing along brilliant Polish crew: saxophonists Wlodzimierz Nahorny and Janusz Muniak, bassist Jacek Ostaszewski and drummer Adam Jedrzejowski. The music, all original compositions by Trzaskowski, is simply brilliant and absolutely pioneering in every respect. Listening to this album in retrospect one can hear clearly that in the historic perspective it was as innovative and groundbreaking as anything else created at the time over the pond and beyond the Iron Curtain. In addition it is also aesthetically beautiful and intellectually challenging. An absolute must to any Polish Jazz enthusiast; this is an essential piece of Polish Jazz history.
