  It's a bit hard to believe this music is from 1978. Where the album lands is somewhere between progressive rock(with some mild jazz influence and avant-garde sympathy) and post-punk. There're some problems with consistency, since the middle section has some shorter stuff(also mellower) that should've been shorter(pun-intended). My favorite off this unusual album is the first track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the openings chords i can hear clear Canterbury influences, reminiscent of National Health's albums from the same year. These moments are abruptly disrupted in a manner which almost remind me of unplugging a cable. What ensues are like the existential hesitations of the likes of Joy Division, with the melancholic melody on the back while the bass-line keeps soloing away; creating an atmosphere of anxious preoccupation that lasts quite a while; until it eventually ends with a King Crimson'like guitar wail that sounds like smashing a mirror. They've contrasted the melodic aspect of post-punk/jazz with King Crimson's fuzzed paranoia(two guitarists btw), and this combination is working like a charm - abandoning the old prog redundancy - the band is already embracing the future. There's material for you math-rock geeks as well. Check out the crazy, jazzy section and the end of the second track, all of these strange stops-accelerations and often dissonant, distorted chords coalesced with their melodic counterpart. Excellent production as well - their great bass player is always audible in the mix and the dynamic drum fills are even better. I'm very surprised to hear such a strong mix from an obscure band.

  A very interesting album for that year, give them a shot if you'd like to have a vague idea how a progressive Robert Fripp would've sounded in 78'. The reissue has some great bonus material as well.

  This CD reissue on Modulus (USA) is a beautifully packaged gatefold mini-LP, with incredible sound, tons of bonus material, a history, photos, etc... A stunning package - as gorgeous as any Japanese mini-LP. It's worth noting that the original is a single sleeve, so this is an improvement in that category as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What's even more amazing, is the bonus tracks are even better! Same style of improvised melodic dissonance (how's that for an oxymoron), but perhaps a bit more focused than the album proper. Rare is the case where the bonus tracks exceed the original product.
