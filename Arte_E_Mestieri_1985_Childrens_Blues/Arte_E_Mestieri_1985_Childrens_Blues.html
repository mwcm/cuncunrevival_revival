   Another interesting re-issued album from the label "Electromantic", as well as the definitive jazz approach of A&amp;M, closer to other music genres, strictly not "progressive". Ok sometimes their stuff reminds me of the jazz-progressive genre regarding a few instrumental bands in Italy (think for example of "Linea C", such a competent ensemble co- founded by Stefano Cerri, unfortunately recently missed forever.); nevertheless their exploration in the direction of a few "diverse" music styles (like that concerning the World Music) is always interesting, in spite of relegating the excellent technical drumming by Furio Chirico to a marginal role (almost as a simple rhythmical accompaniment). For instance the horn section and the sax create a remarkable interplay with the electric guitar and the keyboards too, even though naturally their impact is not as much stunning as that unique regarding the most famous album of A&amp;M, entitled "Tilt".anyway even the present 80's obscured work is worthy and useful too, being in my opinion almost equal to "Giro di Valzer per Domani": however try to re-discover both and be happy!!
