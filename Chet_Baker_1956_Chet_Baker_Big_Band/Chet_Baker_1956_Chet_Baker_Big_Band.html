  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Although this album is titled “Chet Baker Big Band” the groups are only of moderate size, eleven and nine piece aggregations though this does not detract from the quality of the music The bonus tracks consist of two Octets and one sextet which are welcome and give a further dimension to the album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Chet Baker is a much more forceful player on these sides than he was with his own Quartet and the Gerry Mulligan Quartet where is playing was more reflective and slightly hesitant.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The album opens with a sprightly arrangement by Jimmy Heath of the standard “A Foggy Day” which has some hard hitting trumpet by Chet and pithy contributions by Phil Urso on tenor and Bobby Timmons at the piano, a fine start to the album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   There is a glorious arrangement by Phil Urso of the old Miff Mole tune “Worryin’ the Life Out of Me” which gets to the heart of the song and features the leader in marvellous form and has short but telling contributions from the arranger on tenor and Bobby Timmons on piano but it is Chet who shines.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Phil Urso’s  arrangement of his own composition “Phil’s Blues” is a swinger and apart from himself on tenor Bud Shank’s booting baritone adds to the proceedings.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The ballad “Darn That Dream” a favourite of Baker’s is arranged by Jimmy Heath and Chet delivers with a tasteful solo, there is also some nice section work by the saxophones.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Apart from Chet’s hard hitting trumpet on the medium paced “Tenderly” it is Art Pepper’s alto which steals the show on Jimmy Heath’s splendid arrangement.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The six Sextet sides are a real bonus with some wonderful solos from Bud Shank on baritone, Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone and Russ Freeman on piano all driven along by the tasteful Shelly Manne on drums.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   These six tracks consist of three originals and three standards, of the standards “Stella by Starlight” is the most interesting and apart from Chet there are interesting solos from Bud Shank and Bob Brookmeyer as well as a typical romping piano solo by Russ Freeman.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On the face of it “Little Man You’ve Had a Busy Day” is an unlikely source of material but it works surprisingly well with a good Bob Brookmeyer solo.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The three originals are written by Bill Holman, Johnny Mandel, and Jack Montrose, it is Bill Holman’s lively “The Half Dozens” which stands out with great solos by all the front line. Not far behind is Johnny Mandel’s “Tommyhawk” and it’s Russ Freeman’s stomping piano solo which stands out.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The four tracks recorded in Paris with French musicians do not have the same immediacy as the Sextet tracks but nevertheless have some good solos from Chet Baker.and are well worth inclusion on the album.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The whole album provides some fine music and Chet Baker is playing at the top of his form and is therefore highly recommended.
