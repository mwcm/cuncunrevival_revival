  PYG (Pyg) was a super-group from Japan, made up of members of the most famous bands of the Group Sounds era: The Tempters, The Spiders and The Tigers. The band was named by Tokyo resident foreign recording artist Alan Merrill, who shared the same management at the time, Watanabe Productions.

  Formed in 1971, the unit was fronted by the two biggest stars of the era: lead singers Kenji Sawada of The Tigers and Kenichi Hagiwara of The Tempters. The musical director of the band was guitarist Takayuki Inouye of The Spiders. The remaining members were Katsuo Ohno on keyboards, Hiroshi Oguchi on drums, and Ittoku "Sally" Kishibe on bass. Session man Yuji Harada, a non "Group Sounds" star, was also added to the line-up as a second drummer. The band were a seven piece ensemble on stage.

  Mostly slow, plodding, vocal prog rock, with one decent guitar driven cut. All lyrics are Japanese. Despite being quite collectable, their albums do not carry much prestige, and their reputation as a quality prog outfit has gone largely unfulfilled. The original vinyl issue came in an extremely thick gatefold cover, designed to house a gimmick device in the hog's nose that you could push, and which would simulate a pig's grunt. Unfortunately, these were not high quality components, and the overwhelming majority of them are completely blown out from use.
