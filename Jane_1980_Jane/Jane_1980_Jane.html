   The trio from the previous album has been extended to a quartet. A full time singer has been brought on board which is not a bad idea since the vocal parts from "Sign NÂ°9" were not really great. There is also a old "Jane" friend present on this album. Werner Nadolny was already featured on the first "Jane" album. He plays the sax on this one (but only on one song).

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The very energetic opening song "On My Way" is rather pleasant. The beat is really strong and the high-pitched voice is not a bad surprise. With this album, it is clear that "Jane" did not abandoned their heavy style, nor the energy of their long career. "New Man In Town" is fully in-line with their hard-rocking music. Very well achieved I must say.

   Some heavy, bluesy notes for the short "Stay With Me" won't transport me with joy. But you know the button to press, I guess. Next of course to reach "Stop The Clock" which opens on a drum solo (???). Rather weird to open a number in this way. This intro lasts for two minutes (!!!) and then, it finally leaves the place to a solid rocking beat. Hess is again so great on the guitar during this very stirring instrumental part.

   The vocals sound pretty decadent here (but I could have made this remark for "New Man In Town". It almost sound as a new- wave number. Hypnotic bass playing and fantastic beat. The voice sounds like the one of Ken Elliott from "Seventh Wave" (an obscure band of the mid seventies who released a great album : "Psi-Fi").

   This album sounds different than the previous "Jane" offering. The voice of course, but not only. The guitar work is as usual very convincing. Almost each number has its Hess moments. Even the jazzy and average "Rockin' Around".

   "Easy Going" starts with a keys session (which aren't that many here). Rhythm is again very strong and the vocals are irresistibly John Foxx (Ultravox!) oriented.

   Heavy sounds again during "Love Your Life" which is not the best offering on this work. This album is a pure rock one. Little progressiveness here. But is it globally a good album.

   The whole album has this indefinite decadent feeling. This is mostly due to the vocals. I guess that it is a love / hate situation. I would tend to be more on the former side. This album is pretty even. No real highlights but only one (short) blunder. I quite like "Cadillac Rider" and its almost punkish mode. Quite surprising for "Jane". But I'm very familiar with these sounds. Upbeat and primary rhythm. Tremendous number and my fave here.

   "Jane" will also release an almost reggae song. But it was in the mood by then (as was the new wave). A serious change, but not bad an album at all.
