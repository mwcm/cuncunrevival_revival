   Earland’s Coming To You Live another one of those rare infectious 12? releases which has grown in stature over the years.

   Championed by big names such as Gilles Peterson, Theo Parrish and Moodymann, it has become a firm favourite with DJs and clubbers alike, entertaining many discerning dance-floors. Taken from the original master tapes, and released on 180g vinyl.

   The groove here is greatly helped out by arrangements from Tom Washington, Weldon Irvine, and Marcus Miller – all great talents for mixing soul into Earland’s jazzier keyboards – yet in a way that still keeps all of the best elements intact! Many of the tracks feature vocals, but in a gently soulful way that glides in nicely alongside the keys – and speaking of keys, Charles plays Fender Rhodes and Arp here in addition to his usual organ.

   One of Charles Earland's sweet albums from his years at Columbia Records – done in a mode that's much more R&amp;B than his earliest work, but in a style that's still A-OK with us! The groove here is greatly helped out by arrangements from Tom Washington, Weldon Irvine, and Marcus Miller – all great talents for mixing soul into Earland's jazzier keyboards – yet in a way that still keeps all of the best elements intact! Many of the tracks feature vocals, but in a gently soulful way that glides in nicely alongside the keys – and speaking of keys, Charles plays Fender Rhodes and Arp here in addition to his usual organ. Titles include "Coming To You Live", "Spend The Night With Me", "Take Me To Heaven", "Cornbread", "Good Question", "Zee Funkin Space", and "I Will Never Tell".
