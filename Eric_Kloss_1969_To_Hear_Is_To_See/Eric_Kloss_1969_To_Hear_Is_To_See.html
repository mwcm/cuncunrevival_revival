   An all-star rhythm section backs up saxophonist Eric Kloss for this 1969 Prestige release. Chick Corea, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette (all of whom were working with Miles Davis in the late '60's) join the saxophonist for a set of varied but consistently good post-bop tunes.

   At first listen the tune appears to be a funky blues in the style of Horace Silver or Duke Pearson. On closer inspection one will find that the melody is actually cleverly phrased in 7/8. Kloss’s joyful solo sounds like an adventurous Cannonball Adderley and Chick Corea’s comping on Rhodes supports him perfectly.

   Things go in a different direction on “The Kingdom Within” as it opens with a free improv section that eventually turns into lovely modal tune. In his solo Kloss sounds almost like Coltrane on alto with soulful blues-inflected modal sound. “Stone Groove” is funky and swings but drifts freely into other rhythmic areas during the solos. Once again Kloss’ solo is the highlight here and the band sounds their best as they reach a fever pitch at the apex of his solo.

   “Children of the Morning” is an optimistic sounding straight-eighth number and possibly the weakest track. Kloss doesn’t seem to muster the energy he achieves in the other tunes, but Corea gives probably his best solo of the record. For “Cynara” the band dives back into time signature play with a tight 5/4 vamp and a beatifully dissonant melody. The tune is a nice vehicle for Kloss and Co. and they are able to slip in and out of time and harmony with ease.

   This is arguably Kloss’ best recording, thanks in large part to the excellent rhythm section. As with most good jazz, the soloist feeds off of his rhythm section who, in turn, feed off of him creating some really great music.
