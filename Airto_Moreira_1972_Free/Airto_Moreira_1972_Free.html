   Free is an album by Brazilian jazz drummer and percussionist Airto Moreira (who was credited simply as "Airto") featuring performances recorded in 1972 and released on the CTI label. The album reached number 30 in the Billboard Jazz albums charts.

   Other than a couple of obscure efforts for Buddah in 1970, this was percussionist Airto's debut as a leader, and this is still his most famous record. A brass section arranged by Don Sebesky is heard on two tracks, and such all-stars as keyboardist Chick Corea, flutist Hubert Laws, the reeds of Joe Farrell, and even pianist Keith Jarrett and guitarist George Benson make worthwhile appearances. Flora Purim joins Airto in the one vocal piece ("Free"), and "Return to Forever" receives an early recording. The music combines together jazz, Brazilian music, and aspects of fusion and funk quite successfully.

   Airto Moreira's first album for Creed Taylor's nascent jazz-fusion label CTI contributed magnificently to Taylor's modus operandi--expanding the boundaries of jazz to include elements of indigenous cultures, rock, and even classical modes. FREE is Airto in full, unencumbered flight.

   His version of Chick Corea's own genre-defining classic "Return to Forever" sets the listener adrift in a choppy sea of vocal atmospheres, crests of electric piano, and Airto's simmering squall lines of percussion. The title track conjures the Brazilian rainforest with a thick underbrush of rhythm, tribal howls, and chatter. Airto and his cohorts play a wonderful array of ceremonial woodblocks, wood flutes, and other natural Brazilian noisemakers. Accompanying the percussionist are such stellar figures as Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Stanley Clarke, Ron Carter, and George Benson.

   I have a lot of Airto's stuff, particularly the CTI and Arista recordings, but I never owned this one. Originally I thought "How different could this one be from the rest?", but one listening proved I was mistaken in that notion. Airto brings an all-star cast that includes his associates in the original Return to Forever (the album for ECM had just been recorded so this was captured at an amazing period for Airto's development) Chick Corea and the amazing Joe Farrell, as well as Keith Jarrett (a rare guest appearance for him) and the CTI stable of Ron "The Rock" Carter on bass, George Benson on guitar, Hubert Laws on flute and others. Airto plays ALL PERCUSSION heard, including drum kit -- something only rarely heard like on the original RTF ECM recording but something we should hear more of-- I saw Airto play standard kit in the 90s and his feel is amazing, particularly on the Brazilian-infused selections, of course (as a jazz drummer myself, I know a little bit about such things). There is lots of tasty flute on these cuts, giving an airy, light feel to the music. A great choice of material as well, better than the other CTIs of Airto because it really has an ensemble feel and the Sebesky arrangements lend a beautiful feel to the whole thing-- I hear a lot of the same approach on Jobim's masterwork from the same period "Stone Flower"... so, killer musicians + great tunes= one hell of an outing for the pioneering percussionist and grand master of all things struck with a stick. Salud Airto!

   Here is a jem of an album. Airto Moreira, or Airto, as he was known in the early days, was a fusion pioneer who participated in the most important projects, has recorded some superb albums under his own name. When you think Miles, Weather Report, Chick Corea - think Airto. This album is one of his very best, for its subtlety, depth of feeling and lush arrangements with flute, piano, guitar, electric piano, lots of percussion, voices as well. You get a superb rendition of Return To Forever, gorgeous Flora's Song, the wild, almost savage Free, the rest of the album some pretty elegant and hip Brazilian fusion with a variery of rythms. Dreamy, exotic music.

   Having left Weather Report and now being a member of Return To Forever, Airto didn’t stop making his own solo album, and this one is contemporary of his RTF days, and just in case you didn’t catch it the first time around, he included the opening track to remind you of it. Actually, you’ll find the whole of RTF guesting at one point or another in the course of the album, even if wife Flora is the more discreet of the quintet. Among the better-known other guests are Jarrett, Carter, Laws, Benson and Berliner. As was the case with some fellow Brazilians (Deodato comes to mind), Airto found refuge on Creed Taylor’s CTI label, for better or worse.

   Opening on the superb and epic Corea-penned RTF, the album promises to be a superb fusion album, the cover having more spunk than the original eponymous tune on the debut album as the whole group delves deeper in themselves. Well the ECM production might have also something to do with that as well. The following Flora’s self-penned Song has a definite Latin sound, partly due to Berliner’s near-flamenco guitar, but it develops into an enjoyable but gentler fusion piece, where Laws’ flute contrasts with Farrell’s winds and the brass section in the background providing great depth.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The flipside opens with another lengthy title track that opens rather free and dissonant, as if we were in the jungle at dawn either in Africa or in the Amazon and later develops in a lengthy African-raga-jam, but nothing dissonant. Definitely not my fave, but interesting enough if not played repetitively. The short Jarrett-penned Lucky Southern (featuring Keith himself) sticks out a bit from the rest of the album, but it’s more a production thing (loudness) than a non-Latin feel, which it has. The closing Creek is again gentle Brazilian bossa that is rather pleasant, but it fails to match the energy of the fusion of the A-side or the transe set in the title track.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Two bonus tracks have been tagged on the original album for the first CD reissue, the Jarrett-penned first So Tender being some kind of fast-paced little sister to the Lucky one, while the latter is more linked with the bossa of Creek. As is often the case with the CTI label, Free is relatively soft-sounding, but in this case, the music is not always safe semi-elevator jazz. Definitely worth the investigation for the first side, the flipside might have you pondering on the investment. A schizophrenic album.
