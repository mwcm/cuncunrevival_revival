   I always hope to stumble across a totally forgotten and yet totally amazing piece of music that I had no idea even existed. This doesn't happen nearly as often as I'd like, but when it does happen, it's always a welcome surprise. So it's with great pleasure that I am able to present one such piece of music for you today.

   Stepps were a Sydney-based five-piece band who played around town during the second half of the seventies. The band appeared at a variety of venues around Sydney and held down a weekly residency at the Royal George Hotel. Their other notable achievements included a live broadcast concert in 1978 on ABC and airplay on the radio station that used to be known as Double J (the old name for the 'Triple J' radio station for you overseas people and Gen Y kids).

   The band decided to self-release an album of their material to promote their music. The band pressed the album themselves and even photocopied the artwork for the cover themselves at a local printing firm. As is often the case with this type of release, not many were pressed – in fact, the run was limited to only 50 copies. The yellow-label privately pressed record is housed in a plain white sleeve adorned only with photocopied pages that are hand-pasted to both sides of the cardboard cover. The material on the album was recorded in 1975 and 1976 in Sydney, and released early in 1976.

   The style of music is jazz-rock with an unashamedly optimistic mood. Bernie Morgan's singing is quite beautiful on the songs she features on. Her voice compliments the music perfectly. But it's the musicianship that is the real highlight of the album. In terms of Australian music, obvious reference points (in terms of both musical style and the record as an artifact) are Canberra's Yaraandoo and the Rob Thomsett Group's Haro album. While I haven't given Yaraandoo a proper listen, this album is a much better record than the later mentioned.

   The whole first side of Waltz For Tiger Joe is fantastic. The opening track washes over your ears like warm sunshine. It's quintessentially Australian jazz-funk sound is similar in places to Jackie Orszaczky's 1975 LP, and Bernie's singing also reminds me of Kerrie Biddell's best jazz moments. If I Knew is a jazz ballad that changes up into a mostly instrumental fusion number. The first side finishes with the best cut on the album – Kryptonite. Written by the band's guitarist, Ian Hildebrand, the distorted intro gives way to a compelling guitar riff that easily lodges itself in your head. Washes of keys and funky drumming keep this tune grooving all the way through until the players weave their way into a bass-guitar solo interlude that acts almost as a signature for the band. And as the bass player signals his intent to conclude, the other players effortlessly reintroduce that compelling guitar riff.

   The band can't top Kryptonite for the rest of the record, but they get close with Side Two's opener Make Me – a great vocal jazz cut with Bernie Morgan at her most prominent post on the whole record. What's great about this number is the way that the music perfectly compliments Bernie's voice, even following her individual words in some parts. It's a great indicator of how effectively the players must have worked together – that coalescence of sounds that's so hard to achieve. The other great cut on Side 2 is End Of Play, composed by Oleg Ditrich, the band's keyboardist (is that a real word?). It's quite a long number, and in typical fusion style, there's plenty of changes to keep it interesting. Bernie adds to the flavour in parts, but it's mostly an instrumental affair.

   All in all, I think this record is fantastic. While particular songs do stand out, the record works really well as a complete album, and will certainly get some play from me this summer!

   I was quite surprised to find that this album has been re-released on CD, although it now appears to be out of print. You can buy the album through iTunes here. Note though that the album seems to be touched up compared with the original release.

   The thing I just love about finding privately pressed albums is that you often find little mementos that make the record so much more personal. Sometimes the record is signed, and sometimes there are other signs that the record was passed directly from the band (or a member) to someone they know or had a connection with. In this case, I was very lucky to find a hand-written note included in my copy of this record. It's written from Ralph Cooper and Bernie Morgan, the drummer and singer respectively. I'm not sure to whom it is addressed, but it seems likely that they might have been a radio programmer.

   A great Aussie Fusion act from Sydney, which never made it to the recordings of a proper album, Stepps performed regularly from mid- to late-70's at local clubs and hotels and even got some rare airplay on TV and radio at the end of their brief road.They recorded the album ''Waltz for Tiger Joe'' (1976, private) on their own forces, but only 50 copies were pressed and handed to friends, so there are no signs it was ever commercially available. Shame, because they played dreamy yet intense Jazz Fusion with some Canterbury edges, similar to National Health and Belgians Cos, fronted by Morgan's wordless voice experiments and the stunning performance of the musicians, leading to great grooves and unexpected breaks. This was far from average Fusion, the album has a constant tendency towards jazzy Prog Rock through all those tempo changes and complex instrumental patterns, which combine Female vocal Pop and Fusion and electric piano-driven Jazz Rock. Great guitar work and some furious piano paces, who also delivers a few impressive synth flights throughout. Pretty long tracks with lots of instrumental room and lovely interplays.
