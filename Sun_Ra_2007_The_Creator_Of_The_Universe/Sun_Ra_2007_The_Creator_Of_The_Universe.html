  No lineup information on the cd, but it should be the usual during this 1971 period.

   If you are like me and already have a large Ra collection, this should be your next addition. A bunch of great material is still coming out, whether reissues of obscure Saturn studio albums or concert recordings. While I can truly say I've never heard a Ra recording that was less than interesting, few at this point are radically different than the Ra I've known and loved for 35 years. But as the folks who issued "The Creator Of The Universe" say, "This is a Sun Ra album like no other!", and they are right.

   The first disc of this set is highlighted by an incendiary call-and-response between Ra and the Arkestra, recorded in performance in 1971. I've never heard anything like it, either on the 50 or so Ra LPs and CDs in my collection or during my years of experiencing Ra in concert. This-- as well as the bulk of the disc 1 material-- is the "outside" Ra, beloved to many of us, but probably not the place to start for the uninitiated.

   Disc 2 is a recording of a Ra lecture at UC Berkeley from the same year. The topics are weighty, but the touch is light, demonstrating Ra's love for wordplay and his use of humor in approaching personal and societal issues that are really quite profound. Though you may not cue this one up often, it is a great companion to Ra's musical output.

   This set is a must for the Ra collector, but the newly curious should look elsewhere, perhaps the "Montreux Concert" for a particularly broad Ra experience.

   Volume one in a new series entitled The Lost Reel Collection, and this one is the holy grail of Sun Ra history! Two-CD set of the Arkestra playing live in a SF warehouse in 1971, and a lecture by Ra from his legendary 1971 residency at UC Berkeley. Recently the Transparency label was approached with a collection of eleven reel-to-reel tapes of previously unknown Sun Ra recordings. None of this material is on any tape trader list or in any discography. The recordings are all super-high-quality and are being officially released on the Transparency label. Both discs of The Creator of the Universe are from mid-1971. Disc One is a concert at a warehouse in San Francisco, the centerpiece of which is a very dramatic and intense 20 minute Declamation by Ra urging the black race to rise up into freedom and identity, punctuated by the horns of the Arkestra. Completely amazing, this piece is ranked by one aficionado as the peak of Ra's career. Disc Two is one of the classes given by Ra during his teaching residency at UC Berkeley. This is a Sun Ra album like no other!

   Disc one is recorded in mono. Disc two is a stereo recording of one of the classes given by Sun Ra during his teaching residency at UC Berkeley. This class was known as both Sun Ra 171 and The Black Man In The Cosmos. Original tapes are 1/2 track recorded at 7 1/2 ips.

   Aptly titled, The Creator of the Universe features previously unreleased, live Sun Ra material from the early '70s that represents the futuristic musical cosmology of one of jazz's great innovators. The first installation in the Lost Reel series -- comprising a set of recordings (discovered in the 2000s) of Sun Ra rehearsing, performing live, and speaking -- this two-disc set is a treasure trove for collectors. Disc one captures a warehouse concert from 1971, while the second disc (and this is a special treat) features recordings from the same period of Sun Ra lecturing during his teaching residency at UC Berkeley.
