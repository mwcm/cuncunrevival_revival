  Animated sci-fi masterpiece La Planète Sauvage (a.k.a. Fantastic Planet), winner at Cannes Film Festival in 1973, is a bizarre and beautiful film. Towering blue-skinned figures, tiny humanoids in the midst of revolt, and drug-induced Tantric sex transport viewers to a truly magical setting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Composer Alain Goraguer creates an equally hypnotic score from a palette of effects-laden guitars, flutes, Fender Rhodes and strings. While the lush arrangements are reminiscent of Goraguer's collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg in the 1960s, space-age synth flourishes suggest a more psychedelic era. Moody vignettes flow together in tense, slow-paced funk rhythms and Baroque textures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as no surprise that La Planète Sauvage has been cited as an influence on contemporary artists such as French duo Air and American hip-hop producers J Dilla and Madlib. Gorgeous, interplanetary soundscapes resemble the surreal meeting point between Pink Floyd's Obscured by Clouds and Broadcast's Future Crayon.

  Even if you know nothing about the movie, this recording stands well enough on its own. Really trippy and dense, it is a testament to the unfortunate reality that they just don't make 'em like this anymore. Tastefully orchestrated and uniquely original. A must for the collector of the avante-garde, psychedelic, or experimental.
  <br/>
  If you are familiar with the film (an animation milestone and a great film in its own right), you may be suprised at the length of the soundtrack and that there are many tracks that were not used in the film. NO B.S. here. And don't be turned off by the flat sound of the actual film. The sound quality is excellent; the music is even better.
  <br/>
  Actually at times sounds like you are being persued by a race of giant blue aliens, but at the same time you are in awe of the mistique and odd beauty of the landscape-- the fantastic planet, with its strange unearthly creatures, creepy soundscapes, surreal psychic energy.
  <br/>
  A classic by a quite unknown composer whom was rightfully selected to realize the score to this great film, and by the grace of the gods, and the mercy of the giant blue Traags, his work is available to us here on a planet which is just as savage, but not nearly as fantastic.

  5 stars for the atmosphere that this album creates alone. It is genuinely creepy, but not like in a Halloween-like way. Not a rock album (has common elements), not really a new age type of album either. 5 stars for the instrumentation and occaisional backing vocals (that clavichord/ wah wah guitar just oozes from the speakers. Strings, drums, and bass complement nicely. The sound is just delicious. 5 stars for the actual music, which ranges from soothing to driving to outright freakish at times. Always odd, never boring. 5 stars for the production and originality.

  <br/>
  This long out-of-print vinyl release features the original soundtrack recording and newly designed artwork. Recommended for fans of Ennio Morricone, Basil Kirchin and David Axelrod.
