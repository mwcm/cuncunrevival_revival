   Pharoah Sanders's Izipho Zam (My Gifts), originally released in 1973. "Popular and increasingly in demand, Izipho Zam (My Gifts) falls into the 'rare' category among record collectors and is a gift to fans of master Pharoah Sanders. This demand is partially galvanized by the fact that 'Prince Of Peace' has become an inspirational mine to hip hop artists and is much loved by samplers. Izipho Zam is Pharoah Sander's third album, initially recorded in January 1969, it was originally released on the Strata-East label in 1973. On Izipho Zam, Sanders and his band take you on a journey into another world providing an amazing experience! Passionate, intense and free, Sanders saxophone especially, is exquisite, pouring out its soul telling a story of its own. Hailed by peers as the best tenor saxophonist in the world, Pharoah Sanders is a legend in jazz music. He is regarded as one of the pioneers of free jazz and is the mentor of jazz giant, saxophonist Robert Stewart. Born in 1940 into a musical family as Farell Sanders in Arkansas, he first played the clarinet before switching to tenor saxophone in high school. After high school, he moved to California to study music and art. In 1961, Sanders moved to New York where he often played gigs with a number of free jazz dignitaries including Billy Higgins, Sun Ra and Don Cherry. His name 'Pharoah' was given to him by Sun Ra, who was his bandleader then. It was during one of these gigs that he met John Coltrane who became his mentor. While playing with Coltrane, Sanders inevitably rose to prominence due to his very distinctive tenor saxophone sound."

   The hard-to-find Pharoah Sanders LP Izipho Zam (My Gifts) was the first album he recorded as a bandleader following the death of John Coltrane in 1967 (he had recorded two previous albums: his debut, Pharaoh Sanders Quintet, in 1965, for the ESP-Disk label, and Tauhid for Impulse!). Recorded in 1969, it is possible that Impulse rejected this album because of its uncompromising nature. As a result, it was issued on the fairly obscure Strata-East Records label some four years after it was recorded, following a string of well-received albums for Impulse. His group features many soon-to-be legends of the out jazz world: Sonny Fortune (alto saxophone), Cecil McBee (bass), Sonny Sharrock (guitar), and Sirone (bass). The opener should be familiar to fans of Jewels of Thought. There titled "Hum-Allah-Hum-Allah-Hum Allah," here it is presented in a somewhat stripped down form as "Prince of Peace," highlighted by Leon Thomas' distinctive throat singing. I've never been a fan of that particular track, and as a result, the album does not begin auspiciously. "Balance," the second track, however, might stand of Pharoah Sanders' defining moment as a bandleader. It is pure chaos of the highest order, highlighted by Sharrock's appropriately deployed rhythm guitar frenzy and Howard Johnson's complementary tuba playing. The track weaves in and out of structured and unstructured sections deftly. Fans of Sanders must hear this one. The nearly half-hour-long title track closes out the album in strong fashion. Though it can't match the torrent generated by "Balance," it is a slow builder that features solid contributions from each player. This overlooked album should be a part of any free jazz fan's collection.

   A rare non-Impulse Records album from the early days of Pharoah Sanders – but a set that ranks right up there with his classics for that legendary label! The album's one of the classics in Strata East's Dolphy Series – and it's a uniquely collaborative session from 1969, one that has Sanders working with a largeish group that includes Sonny Fortune on alto sax, Sonny Sharrock on guitar, Lonnie Liston Smith on piano, Leon Thomas on vocals, and Cecil McBee on bass – all coming together with a freely exploratory sort of energy, one that's a bit like some of Archie Shepp's most righteous sides from the same time. Sanders' tenor still dominates most numbers, but not as much as on some of the Impulse sides – and there's a nicely relaxed and personal feel to the whole album.
