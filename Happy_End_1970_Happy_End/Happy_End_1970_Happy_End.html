   Happy End occupies a lonely place in the Japanese pantheon of rock divinities, for the band’s members were the first to be brave (and percipient) enough to insist on presenting their songs in the Japanese language. This was at a time when such an idea was still considered un-authentic and slightly gauche, but the band persisted and ultimately won the day. Unlike most contemporary Japanese bands of the time, Happy End also refused to sweeten their albums with scatterings of Western rock covers, which has resulted in their work having long term homeland respect but precious little of musical value to the keen Western Japrock freak. For the truth is that Happy End’s music is most reminiscent of soft rock such as WHEATFIELD SOUL-period Guess Who, a slightly heavier CS&amp;Y and Badfinger, and contains no real musical highs such as guitar or organ solos of merit. Happy End was formed in 1969 by Apryl Fool’s highly talented rhythm section Haruomi Hosono and Takashi Matsumoto, who were both songwriters of considerable note. The band signed to the experimental and visionary record label URC (Underground Record Club), which had set its sights on celebrating Japan-o-centric culture statements, many of which are too insular for most Western rock ears. The band’s first LP HAPPY END was to these ears their best effort by far, each subsequent release being slightly blander, although the second LP LAEMACHI ROMAN has its moments. Signing to the larger King record label, Happy End had Van Dyke Parks produce their third LP confusingly also entitled HAPPY END. A concert recording from 1972 was released posthumously in 1974 as the LP LIVE HAPPY END.

   The band existed between 1969-73, during which time they enjoyed no major record sales, but were always darlings of the rock critics, especially when they collaborated with Little Feat’s Lowell George on the song ‘Sayonara America, Sayonara Nippon’. They also had the nerve to back acoustic folk singer Nobuyasu Okabayashi when he went electric, even though it was considered a Dylan-like act of treachery to traditionalists. Nowadays, with all of its band members having achieved a consistent level of success, Happy End is best known for the song ‘Kaze Wo Atsumete’, which was featured in the movie LOST IN TRANSLATION. Bass player Hosono later formed the highly influencial Yellow Magic Orchestra, while drummer Matsumoto would later direct movies and write Top Ten hits for Eastern stars Agnes Chan, Masahiro Kuwana and Seiko Matsuda.

   Between 1970 and 1973, Happy End explored the possibilities of blending Western folk singing with Japanese melodies. Unlike many other bands of this era, Happy End, led by Haroumi Hosono and Takashi Matsumoto, sang in Japanese, a highly influential gesture in this anglophone-dominated era. Hosono later went on to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra.

   The band's pioneering avant-garde sound is highly revered, and they are considered to be one of the most influential bands in Japanese music.

   This album is great! The first of three studio albums from Happy End. Many people may think that Happy End is a Western-style rock band from Japan, yes, they are a rock band, but very Japanese. The lyrics by Matsumoto Takashi are great, and if you like "Kaze Machi Roman", this album is a must! They go together perfectly...different but still consistent. The opening song "Haru yo Koi" just rocks..reminds me of Hot Tuna's "Phosphorescent Rat" just a tad bit. This album is more free and psychedelic. If you like Jefferson Airplane, early RC Succession, Nick Drake, or late 60's rock, folk rock, you will love this album! Highly recommended and if the bonus tracks are on here, the alternate take of "Juunigatsu no Ame no Hi" is awesome.

   All the album's lyrics were written by Takashi Matsumoto, with the exception of "Tobenai Sora" (Haruomi Hosono) and "Ira Ira" (Eiichi Ohtaki).

   This album marked an important turning point in Japanese music history, as it sparked what would be known as the "Japanese-language rock controversy" (Nihongo Rokku Ronso?). There were highly publicized debates held between prominent figures in the Japanese rock industry, most notably the members of Happy End and Yuya Uchida, regarding whether Japanese rock music sung entirely in Japanese was sustainable (previously, almost all popular rock music in Japan was sung in English). The success of Happy End's debut album, as well as their following album Kazemachi Roman, proved the sustainability of Japanese-language rock in Japan

   Who'da thought that the best Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young album would actually be a Hosono Ohtaki Matsumoto &amp; Suzuki album?
