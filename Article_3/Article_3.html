   Flood of divinity and psych-solemn brilliance, even though based upon bluesy rock sounds. J. A. CAESAR is a Japanese theatrical superstar, let me shout.

   Tokyo playwright, director and artist J.A. Caesar sprang to prominence in the early '70s largely through his work with Shuji Terayama's Tenjo Sajiki Theatre, specializing in vaguely sinister music reminiscent of a Hammer House Of Horrors soundtrack. 1973's Kokkyou Junreika release, often considered Caesar's finest work, was culled from the 5 hours of music written for the original play, distilled down to an album's worth of ageless chants, Buddhist mantras, heavenly invocations and fuzztone guitar vamps supported by Caesar's droning electric organ and the eerie female vocals of Yoko Ran, Keiko Shinko and Seigo Showa. An album that sits comfortably alongside early Ash Ra Tempel, Cosmic Jokers and Atem-period Tangerine Dream.

   Taking the case of the first track "Echigo Tsutsuishi Oyashirazu", deep drum beating and melody flying / floating blended with mysteriously voices following flute (wabue?) vibes in the very beginning have obvious musical innovation. This project has been based upon illuminative theatre and this makes sense. Takaaki, as a couple of theatre casts, plays auditory dramas. His voices are a bit cheesy but sometimes remind us a strong passion like Demetrio Stratos. "Tenshotan" is a lazy, sloppy story created by a female reciter, with unstable melody lines ... going to extremes is amazing, please feel enough. Bluesy "Haha Koishiya Sangosho" is slightly poppy but a deeply dark bullet launcher. Cannot help stepping back with hearing that, oh man. "Kyojobushi" means "a song for crazy women", followed by "Eimei Shihen", another madness ... that's it. Drenched in continual shouts and mind-blowing high-tone voices, without refined melodic texture, but this stuff consists of innovative collective, namely such a neat phenomenon brushed up by crazy mademoiselles and crazy Takaaki.

   Female extreme pitchshift horror based upon symphonic / psychedelic slowdown in "Wasan" gives us palpitation and chill. Regardless of its melodic beauty and power, something fuzzy can be felt around us. Who knows the reason. Mystery. "Jinriki Hiko No Tame No Enzetsu Soan" is another symphonic psychedelia along with Takaaki's inorganic but aggressive storytelling, which content is too difficult for me to give an explanation but his mind-altering power affects our brain massively. The following "Minkan Iryojutsu" sounds like an ambient sound hoaxer, that shows fishy medical appearance for addicting common people without knowledge enough. So tough to listen carefully indeed. "Otori No Kuru Hi" is quite suitable for the last scene of this dramatic theatre. Female high-tone voices are crazier than previously, and psychic symphony takes off and flies over and over. Magnificent, powerful percussion and guitar blows our minds so impressively that we cannot avoid squeezing breath into our throat. Our tears get brilliant expression via such a tragic keyboard play upon the very last part.
