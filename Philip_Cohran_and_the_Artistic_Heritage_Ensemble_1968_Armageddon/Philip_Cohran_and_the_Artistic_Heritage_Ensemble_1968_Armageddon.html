  Armageddon was conceived in 1958 and written down in 1963. After performing with Sun Ra and benefitting from the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, Phil Cohran's compositions changed decidedly, and he began to focus on cosmology and culture.

   Contrast and conflict is how Philip Cohran paints his picture of Armageddon. Fear and hope, destruction and rebirth all co-exist and struggle for supremacy on this stunning live recording. From first contact, we are greeted with the harrowing rendition of the Negro-Spiritual ‘Motherless Child’ by a powerful and commanding male bass vocalist. Not what one is accustomed to if they have ever heard any other rendition of the song. To hear a voice with such presence sound so vulnerable is as beautiful as it is unnerving, foreboding of the themes and musical conflict to come.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The contrast is amplified by a maternal female vocalists rendition singing the second refrain of the song. A comparatively tender and loving rendition, filled with hope and comfort- thus summerising Cohran’s view of the aremmegedon he believes is soon upon us. For everyone- the strong and powerful, the pure and loving will be feel like a motherless child once cast into its chaos.

   Beauty and violence collide in an uneasy marriage on the following tracks- Funky jams provided by an afro-inspired rhythm sections and relentless bass lines are accompanied by punchy foreboding horns which descend into anarchy. Soft fluttering drums transform into chaos and piercing saxophones pervert ethereal atmospheres, providing a self-perpetuating battle for dominion.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Whilst one might think (myself included) the title track would be the final descent into the abyss, my expectations were subverted- Whilst Cohran's words of warning give birth to the climatic conflict of the album, the conflict gives birth to the most spiritual and hopeful ending. Almost like an exorcism, Cohran’s preaching over the chaos purges the conflict. The once violent horns become tender, akin to the nurturing voice at the beginning. The shrill saxophones become a warm blanket. The eruptting drums metamorphosis into almost Buddhist like prayer chimes. Peace, love and beauty prevails.
