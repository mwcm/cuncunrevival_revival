   The band released Snake Rattle and Roll in 1978, a slightly more commercial album targeting mainly the US market. The album received a lot of airplay, but limited sales. “How Will You Break My Heart” and “Where Is The Money?”; broken hearts and money, or lack of it, were themes in many of Crawler’s songs.

   An exhaustive series of live performances found Crawler as support band for the likes of Robin Trower, Cheap Trick, and Foreigner and a 54 date tour across the USA as support band for Kansas. At the end of a USA tour in December 1978, keyboard player John ‘Rabbit’ Bundrick left to work with “The Who” and the band folded soon after.

   The melodic aspects hinted at on Crawler come into full bloom on this album to great effect as the band move further away from their blues-rock origins to create a much fuller, richer sound. The songs are distinctive and the harmony singing adds an extra dimension.

   Snake, Rattle &amp; Roll is the best effort served-up from Crawler, which features more rock than previous efforts, yet retains the vital blues influence. Released in 1978, when rock 'n' roll was not in vogue, the album was recorded at the Caribou Ranch in Colorado, with Gary Lyons holding down the production. The songwriting is solid and the recording is tight throughout this collection of ten tracks.

   The disc contains 37-minutes of quality music, which is kick started by the first cut "Sail On". Other stellar tracks on offer here include "One Way Street", "Muddy Water" (which was originally recorded by Free for their last studio work Heartbreaker), and "Midnight Blues".

   A marvellous effort that got submerged in a music scene dominated by the squalid world of punk.
