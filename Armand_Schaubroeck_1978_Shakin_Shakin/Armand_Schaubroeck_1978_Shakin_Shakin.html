   All the songs on Shakin' Shakin' were "written by Armand Schaubroeck right after they were recorded December 29, 1977 -- January 2, 1978," or so it says on the back of the vertigo-inducing LP cover, and this unique and highly enjoyable mix of lighthearted pop might as well be Lou Reed fronting the B-52's -- Lou Reed with his tongue not in his cheek. Schaubroeck throws it right in your face, and that's part of his charm, the title track rocking out with enthusiastic pseudo-rockabilly smarts, "We Like Bad Girls They're More Fun" reinventing the Royal Teens' 1958 hit, "Shorts Shorts, as well as copping that tune's melody. "The Lady's a Traitor" descends into the depths of Schaubroeck's classic Ratfucker album, the artist fooling listeners that he would keep things lighthearted on this outing. Side two has one of those hypnotic circles on the label, which is a nice visual to go along with this dementia -- the passionate plea of "Baby! Baby! Stay Gone" ("I ripped up all your pictures/Moved the furniture around/Baby I love you, but please stay gone") is angst without telling listeners why. It's a tremendous statement, and Schaubroeck outdoes cult heroes Roky Erickson and Wild Man Fischer on every level. The smart production and enthusiastic performance give away Schaubroeck's secret; he's clever as a fox. "Pretty Baby," like the song before it, relies heavily on Bernie Heveron's very vocal basslines. The final track, "?," is a bizarre minute and a half of vulgarity that has its own twisted charm. This was the first of three albums Schaubroeck would release in 1978, part of a catalog of limited output for such a highly creative individual. It's too bad there's not a lot more, because this is definitely worth seeking out and enjoying.
