   Giuseppe "J.B.""Baffo" Banfi was the keyboardist and founder of the Italian prog group Biglietto per L'Inferno. They managed a self-entitled album in 1974 on the Trident label, but a second album was shelved until the 1990s, likely due to the demise of the Trident label around 1975. Biglietto per L'Inferno's music was traditional Italian prog rock, not unlike Il Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, or Osanna. But after the demise of Biglietto, Banfi recorded some electronic music, but he then served military duty, and these collections became Galaxy My Dear, which got released in 1978 on Red Records, without his knowledge. He quickly associated himself with Klaus Schulze (who he met back in 1975 during the final days of Biglietto) and released some more albums on Schulze's I.C. (Innovative Communications) label.

   It's so hard to believe how different Biglietto per L'Inferno is to Banfi's solo career! Forget any references to those Italian groups I mentioned, this is straight-up Berlin-school style electronic music, using tons of analog synthesizers and sequencers that undoubtedly brings to mind the likes of Schulze or Tangerine Dream. Nice spacy synthesizers and sound effects go with it. Fans of this kind of electronic music will have no problem adapting to this album. I always like it when non-German acts, like Sweden's Anna Sjalv Tredje, or (some two decades later) Britain's Radio Massacre International does their stab at the Berlin School of electronic music and succeeds with flying colors. Of course Baffo Banfi had the benefit of collaborating with Schulze, which obviously helped. I highly recommend Galaxy My Dear!

   Admittedly the album was made with acknowledgment to Klaus Schulze who he considered his one major influence on the creation of this recording. Fair enough...

   Anyway, this is a damn sight better than the other Schulze copycat 'Adelbert von Deyen' from the same era who's artwork was excellent but who's music was utter pants.

   A Berlin School onslaught that takes few breathers. The Tangerine Dream/Klaus Schulze influence is obvious, but here there's an even more concerted attention to effects. Some parts of the album are similar in vein to France's Didier Bocquet, but with less restraint and originality. Side two sadly overstays it's welcome with a experimental, rhythm driven piece offering little in the way of progression.. A bit directionless, certainly nothing ground-breaking, but overall not bad. Recommended to you hardcore Berlin electronics folk out there.
