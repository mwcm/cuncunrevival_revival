  First few times that I listened to this live Faust CD, I thought to myself - like, wow! English translation of the title is 'Small World'. These live cuts were recorded during gigs on the long-running krautrock band's 2006 tour from shows they had played in Portugal, Belgium and Austria. Tracks that [more than] made this disc a hang onto until you're gone) keeper are the eleven-minute chaotic opener "Ablach", the almost mainstream-like "I Was Shy Before", the traditional Faust-like "Foam Of War" and the cosmic piece "Auf Frostigem Boden". Also loved the seventeen-minute experimental (absolute bomb!) "Crawling Wax", "Jet Set Lady" (with it's killer harmonica and bluesy vibe) as well as the awesome (that's truly an understatement) finale "Terrorize Me". Line-up: Hans Joachim Irmler - organ, keyboards &amp; vocals, Jan Fride Wolbrandt - drums &amp; percussion, Steven W. Lobdell - guitar, Michael Stoll - bass &amp; flute and Lars Paukstat - percussion. At least as great as a couple of other live Faust titles that comes to mind 'The Land Of Ukko &amp; Rauni' and 'Schiphorst 2008' So extremely highly recommended, that it hurts.
