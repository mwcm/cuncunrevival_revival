   This work is a live recording performed in Royan, a rural town in western France in 1971. The 64-minute nonstop performance is exactly a music drama, a big epic. Repeating manic depression as if man's complicated emotions are revealed is the most problematic work of John Coltrane " Ascension"There is not much to express chaos, like the one. From Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Pharaoh Sanders, Albert Eyler to AAOC, in the late sixties, free jazz overturned the common sense of existing jazz, and developed with a political color to a great movement , It may be said that the end point of such tide flow was periodically and geographically it was this Celestial Communications Orchestra.
