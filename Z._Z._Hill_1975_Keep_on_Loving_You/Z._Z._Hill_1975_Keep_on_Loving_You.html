   Hill's last album for United Artists is another great funk record, produced by soul giants Allen Toussaint and Lamont Dozier.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Dozier produced the first four tracks (side A), which form a mixed, if highly funky, bag. "I Created a Monster" without a doubt is the hardest piece of all-out monster funk that Hill ever waxed. "That Ain't the Way..." on the other hand is a delicate ballad, while "Steppin' in the Shoes..." picks up the pace again in a strange country-funkish way. Finally, there's the bouncy "Two Sides to Every Story", which is pretty good, but features some ghastly synthesizers that almost kill the song.

   Allen Toussaint produced the bulk of the remainder of the LP, and to great effect. Aside the rousing, funky title track, there is the fine ballad "Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)", the busy "Look What You've Done" and the sarcastic "My Turn".

   "I Don't Need Half a Love" ends the album, but actually is a track dating from late 1973, when it was released as a single and became one of Hill's few hits for United Artists.
