   After splitting briefly in 1971 Free reformed at the end of the year and soon after the Christmas and New Year period found themselves once again in the familiar environs of the Island Recording Studios in Basing Street.

   Much has been written about the way this all came to pass so I won't elaborate too much here. But basically a mixture of the disappointing reaction to "Highway". Internal feuds between Rodgers and Fraser, Rodgers and Kossoff, and Kossoff and Fraser added to Kossoffs increasing dependency on, and inability to perform because of, illegal substances meant that the band literally fell apart shortly before it would have torn itself apart. The time away from Free did little to help Kossoff, despite the fact that his and Kirke's splinter group the unimaginatively monikered Kossoff Kirke Tetsu and Rabbit were the only ones to record an album. It has been suggested that in truth he never recovered from the death of close friend Jimi Hendrix during the "Highway" sessions.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In a spirit of reconcilliation Rodgers and Fraser the groups main songwriters brought with them the unfinished tracks from their respective splinter projects Peace and Toby (the naming of bands does not appear to be one of the individual members talents although credit to Kirke for coming up with Bad Company some years later !) and agreed that all tracks would be published as group compositions. This was very much a first for Free and was something that Rodgers never did again throughout Bad Company, The Firm or The Law. Only doing it again on the Queen+Paul Rodgers collaboration.

   The albums title was initially going to be the name of the band way back in the beginning and was coined by Alexis Korner their early mentor.

   Yet again "Free at Last" sees the band developing a slightly different sound. Fraser had developed significantly as a piano and organ player and his playing is much more evident and more to the fore than on previous albums. That doesn't mean there is less Kossoff though. His playing is far more brooding, dark and mysterious than on the early albums. The Gibson literally wails and shrieks in agony and pain through tracks like 'Child' , 'Guardian of the Universe', 'Magic Ship' ,'Soldier Boy', 'Sail On' and 'Goodbye'. Even on the more upbeat and faster paced numbers like 'Little Bit of Love' which gave them another UK Top Twenty single, 'Travelling Man' and 'Catch A Train' the mellow cry of his earlier sound is replaced with a much more agonised tone. All this gives "Free at Last" a much fuller sound than the earlier albums. There is also a fair bit of mellotron on the album as well as some acoustic guitar from Rodgers. More of the gaps have been filled here than on the early albums but without losing that classic Free sound.

   Lyrically the album is very dark and gloomy too which was to be expected I suppose given the circumstances that led to their conception. Fraser had actually kidnapped Kossoff during the split to get him away from his drug related associates. At the time many people heard the lyrics as pleas to Kossoff to sort himself out although Rodgers has always maintained this was not, at least intentionally, the case.

   "Free at Last" is very much Free's grown up album. At times it resembles the majestic cry of a dying beast. It is drenched in emotion, melancholy and darkness far more than any other Free album yet it also shows shafts of light and a hint at what could have been had the demons that took over Kossoff been slain. Only Free could take one song ('Child') and fill it full of sorrow and optimism at the same time. Make no mistake these were musicians and songwriters whose creative talents were at their peak. Lyrically this album may be Rodgers' finest hour.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Sadly it all fell apart again as quickly as it had been put back together. Kossoff was unable to play on numerous occasions and tours and gigs being cancelled was a regular occurrence. On other night Kossoffs playing was a sorry sight by all accounts and yet in typical Free fashion there were still some nights when it all sounded as good as it had done just a year or two earlier.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite the album selling well and reaching #9 in the UK album chart Fraser decided he couldn't take anymore and jumped ship for one final time before an American tour. Tetsu and Rabbit were recruited but Kossoff was left at home to undergo the neuro-electric therapy, which had worked for Eric Clapton and Peter Green, leaving Rodgers to take over guitar duties.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It looked all but over for the band that just a year or so earlier had been widely touted as the successors to The Rolling Stones but there was still one last turn to take on that muddy road even if the road was getting rockier by the day.
