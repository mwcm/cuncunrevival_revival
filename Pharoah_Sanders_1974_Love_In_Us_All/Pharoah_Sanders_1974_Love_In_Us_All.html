   Recorded near the end of Pharoah Sanders' tenure at Impulse, Love in Us All consists of two extended compositions. Together, they serve as an aural representation of the way Sanders' music polarized the jazz world at the time. Like many of his "New Thing" peers, the saxophonist sought the sound world beyond the constraints of conventional harmony. This often translated into music played at the grating, far reaches of his instrument. "To John" finds Sanders in this territory. His solo begins with Coltrane-isms of short motive development before stretching out into a more personal sound. Finding himself engulfed by a rising musical tide, he plays like he's fighting desperately to stay above it. Soon his saxophone takes on a sorrowful tone as if admitting inevitable defeat. With little optimism apparent, it ultimately communicates a sense of emptiness. However, the often one-dimensional criticism of Sanders as an angry, confrontational musician fails to take in the ragged beauty of a work like "Love Is Everywhere." The song offers little explanation as to what the furor was all about. It begins with an exquisite bass vamp that the song builds from. "Love is everywhere" is repeatedly and passionately shouted as the music escalates into a disorienting swirl of sound. Sanders enters midway through with a surprisingly restrained and lyrical solo on soprano. These two songs hardly seem to belong on the same album and are best approached separately. Many of the players who took musical and philosophical inspiration from John Coltrane failed to translate it into resonant works of their own. Sanders' unsuccessful attempt on "To John" falls in this category. Yet, in a way, Coltrane himself never created a work as emotionally direct as "Love Is Everywhere."

   The best possible way to describe Pharoah Sanders‘ sound is “Organized Confusion”, and at times, is compositions are as abstract as jazz can get. Abstract jazz is not for the novice listener. It requires an understanding of depth that the art form can go, as well as the limits in which it can be pushed. The limits are infinite, and Sanders is constantly proving that with his work. Pharoah Sanders’ plays using sheets of sound, and in this two-song album Love in Us All, you can hear a more serene, melodic Sanders on one song, while experiencing the wild, abstract, Sun Ra influenced Sanders on the other.

   As you listen to the song Love is Everywhere, and as the rhythm starts out with a driving tambourine, you can hear how this song can be a precursor to a soulful house style, and as the rhythm of the song falls in and out, the song takes on a new life at the 5:43 mark, as if it was reborn.

   The second song, To John can only be a dedication to one person. The one, the only, John Coltrane. For a certain type of listening ear, this is vintage Sanders, as the free form jazz let’s loose in this 20 minutes session, with 15 of those minutes being a multitude of sounds coming from every direction. A far cry from the beat-driven sound of the soul-jazz fusion, but the free, abstract jazz is an important part of the art.
