   59 years ago this month, John Coltrane released My Favorite Things, an album which owes its existence to Miles Davis’s generosity.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1960, Coltrane and Davis embarked on a European tour which would prove to be the final jaunt that the two musicians would take together, but if one important thing came out of the trip (aside from the 4-disc live collection All Of You: The Final Tour 1960, which was released in 2014), it was Davis’s decision to buy Coltrane a soprano saxophone while they were on their expedition across the pond. Coltrane took to the instrument like a duck to water and started playing it in his initial dates with his new band, the John Coltrane Quartet, featuring bassist Steve Davis, drummer Elvin Jones, and pianist McCoy Tyner.

   Looking back, it’s startling how prolific Coltrane could be: My Favorite Things was released only slightly more than a month after his previous album, Coltrane Jazz. Admittedly, it was an album which required no actual songwriting – all four of its tracks are covers – but the fact that Coltrane was even able to lay it down as quickly as he did is damned impressive.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The covers in question were well-chosen, ageless numbers which remain classics to this day: “My Favorite Things,” “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye,” “Summertime,” and “But Not For Me.” It was the title track in particular, though, that helped build a bridge between jazz and mainstream audiences, and it’s why, even after 55 years, it’s still one of the greatest gateway drugs to learning to love jazz.

   In 1959, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “The Sound of Music” opened on Broadway in New York at a time when show recordings often produced commercial hit songs on the radio. One popular missive from “Sound of Music” was “My Favorite Things,” sung by Broadway star Mary Martin. Who would have known that the melody of that show tune would inspire the innovative saxophonist John Coltrane to produce one of the most renowned albums in the history of jazz music?
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “My Favorite Things” is a recording Coltrane made with his new quartet of McCoy Tyner on piano, Elvin Jones on drums and Steve Davis on bass. The group recorded the album at Atlantic Records’ studios in New York over three days in October 1960. For the session, Coltrane favored the high-pitched sound of the soprano saxophone for the two tracks on side one (of the phonographic long-playing record of the time) and tenor sax for the pair of tracks on side two. Coltrane at the time was playing what was known as “tonal jazz,” using music modes rather than chord progressions. He and McCoy would provide long solos on the album accompanied by Jones’ beats and brushings on the drums and Davis’ acoustic double bass.

   At the time, Coltrane was only recently removed from the Miles Davis Quintet, which he joined in 1958. Coltrane would say that the latitude bandleader and trumpeter Davis gave him allowed him to develop Coltrane’s ability to play various notes at once, which he called “sheets of sound.” Coltrane’s avant garde approach, experimenting and reaching beyond traditional music structures through improvisation, would influence jazz and rock music for years to come.

   Coltrane, born in 1926, grew up with a father who played multiple musical instruments, including the violin, and a mother who was a church pianist. He studied the clarinet and horn and later the saxophone, citing the renowned sax player Lester Young as an early inspiration. He studied music in Philadelphia and after a stint in the U.S. Navy (as a band player) during World War II, worked with the Eddie Vinson Band in the 1940s on tenor sax before taking the big step up to Dizzy Gillespie’s top-flight band and modern-jazz man Davis’ group in the 1950s.

   By the time of “My Favorite Things,” Coltrane had been recording for Atlantic since 1959, when his album “Giant Steps,” showcasing his “sheets of sound” approach, was released. He cited East Indian “raga” music of Ravi Shankar as an influence. “My Favorite Things” lasts a full 40 minutes. For the title track, Coltrane used his soprano sax to alter the chord progressions and went off on improvisational tangents while Tyner on piano kept the Broadway song’s melody going behind him.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The three other cuts on “My Favorite Things” are standards as well. Coltrane’s playing on Cole Porter’s “Every Time We Say Goodbye” is more subdued and less impressive but with his tenor sax on “Summertime” (from the show “Porgy and Bess” by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward) he departs again from the song’s “script” with improvised abandon. The record concludes with a raucous rendition of Ira and George Gershwin’s “But Not for Me,” a show tune from 1930’s “Girl Crazy.” The cut features virtuoso playing by both Coltrane and Tyner.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Coltrane died of liver disease at just 40 years old in 1967, abbreviating his brilliant career. In 1998, more than two decades later, “My Favorite Things” was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, perhaps as a way of making up for not awarding Coltrane a Grammy while he was alive. The album finally reached “gold” status for sales in 2001. It remains a classic for its fascinating, innovative sounds and place in jazz history.

   Although seemingly impossible to comprehend, this landmark jazz date made in 1960 was recorded in less than three days. All the more remarkable is that the same sessions which yielded My Favorite Things would also inform a majority of the albums Coltrane Plays the Blues, Coltrane's Sound, and Coltrane Legacy. It is easy to understand the appeal that these sides continue to hold. The unforced, practically casual soloing styles of the assembled quartet -- which includes Coltrane (soprano/tenor sax), McCoy Tyner (piano), Steve Davis (bass), and Elvin Jones (drums) -- allow for tastefully executed passages à la the Miles Davis Quintet, a trait Coltrane no doubt honed during his tenure in that band. Each track of this album is a joy to revisit. The ultimate listenability may reside in this quartet's capacity to not be overwhelmed by the soloist. Likewise, they are able to push the grooves along surreptitiously and unfettered. For instance, the support that the trio -- most notably Tyner -- gives to Coltrane on the title track winds the melody in and around itself. However, instead of becoming entangled and directionless, these musical sidebars simultaneously define the direction the song is taking. As a soloist, the definitive soprano sax runs during the Cole Porter standard "Everytime We Say Goodbye" and tenor solos on "But Not for Me" easily establish Coltrane as a pioneer of both instruments.
