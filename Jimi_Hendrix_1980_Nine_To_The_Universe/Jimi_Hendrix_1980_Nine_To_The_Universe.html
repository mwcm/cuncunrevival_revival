   This album consists of 5 mind-blowing, ineffably amazing jams. The track "Nine to the Universe" is the only one with vocals...Lord Have Mercy....Ow!!!! and then a climactic jam..and then..I am what I am, Thank God, I Say I am what I am Thank God.., Some people don't understand, help them God..., Some people don't understand, help them God.....and that's it. "Young/Hendrix" includes Larry Young on organ and showcases some of Jimi's most intricate and awe inspiring guitar work ever. "Jimmy/Jimi Jam" starts out with my all time favourite Hendrix riff and fuckin'"jams" all the way through. As far as "Easy Blues" is concerned, the title speaks for itself and is another manifestation of Jimi's sheer innate brilliance. The last cut, "Drone Blues" is incomparably phenomenal as well and includes a different rendition of an excerpt from the incendiary classic jam "Drivin' South". "Nine to the Universe" is hands down one of my favourite Hendrix album of all. It is imperative that this album be officially released on CD.
