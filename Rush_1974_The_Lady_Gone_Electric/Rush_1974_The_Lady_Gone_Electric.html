   Recorded at the Electric Ladyland Studios in New York City, in December 1974 in preparation for their first US tour, this sublime Rush performance was given in front of an audience of 8-12 people in the small studio, and thus provides a fine example of this remarkable band's early live sound. This was also the earliest recording made with Neil Peart on drums, Peart having replaced their former skins-man John Rutsy, a few months before this show.

   They perform material from their first album and new songs from the soon to be released 'Fly by Night' LP. The show was undertaken to provide a live broadcast for FM Radio, and was transmitted across the airwaves prior to the release of 'Fly by Night'. Neil had only been with the band for a few months at this point, but the playing is tight and precise.

   The FBN songs are still coming together, so some, notably "Best I Can", contain some alternate lyrics. The structure of "Fly by Night" is different, with the guitar solo coming after the vocal bridge and a completely different ending. We get a rare treat in "Working Man", when Alex delivers a guitar solo outside of the normal structure of the song. "Bad Boy" is introduced as a Beatles song, although it was originally written and performed by Larry Williams. It's amusing to hear the polite clapping of what sounds like about five or ten folks in the studio. Geddy's soft-spoken comments in between songs are a sharp contrast to the very hard-edged performance. Apparently, several mics were set up around the studio, with only a very basic soundboard feed. The result is a very well-mixed sound - so much so, in places it sounds as though it's lifted direct from the first album.
