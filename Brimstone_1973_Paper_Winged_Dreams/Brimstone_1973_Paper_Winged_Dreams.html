  Official reissue by the band themselves,  an early Seventies harmonic progressive / psych rock band from the USA, who made this excellent album. Long instrumental tracks with keyboard and guitar mixing psych with progressive styles in a fragile ethereal manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formed in Canton, Ohio by Chris Wintrip during the early 1970's. The band went through many incarnations through the years, but will probably be best remembered for their debut album in 1973 titled "Paper Winged Dreams. Features extended instrumental organ/guitar passages, or as is said elsewhere 'long instrumental tracks with keyboard and guitar mixing psych with progressive styles in a fragile ethereal manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Suite In Five Movements” is a complex composition in five movements which features some nice solo vocals complimented by intermingled harmonies; lyrics dominate the music but there's some nice guitar work and counter-pointing vocals; overall well worth investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rather irresistible melodic prog-artrock LP with a light, airy feel throughout. The band belongs at the dreamy Moody Blues and Camel end of the prog spectrum, with flawless vocal harmonies, long classical-inspired keyboard excursions and plenty of superior guitar interplay.'
