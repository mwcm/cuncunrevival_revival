   A Rome-based, five-piece band, ALBERO MOTORE got together in the early Seventies. Their name means "drive shaft" in Italian. They were discovered by the singer and guitarist Ricky Gianco, who produced their first and only album, "Il grande gioco" (released in 1974), and he also wrote the lyrics to all the songs. He then helped them obtain a recording deal with his new label Intingo (which specialised in Italian folk music) when their original label, Car Juke Box, closed down. The following year, Albero Motore released a single by the title "Messico lontano", then disbanded.

   From a musical point of view, the album has few real connections with progressive rock, sounding more like one of the numerous rock-influenced albums by Italian singers-songwriters (cantautori) which were popular at the time. The vocal parts, sung by Maurizio Rota's strong, gutsy voice (often compared to Joe Cocker's) are very much in evidence; while the overall sound of the band is more influenced by American-style, blues-based classic rock than by symphonic prog. Among the eight tracks included in "Il grande gioco", particular mention should be made of "Israele", which addresses the plight of the Palestinian people with the sensitivity typical of many Italian '70s bands towards political issues.

   After the band's end, most of the individual members have continued their career in the Italian music world. Guitarist Fernando Fera is an established sessionman and composer of soundtracks; while lead vocalist Marcello Rota still performs in the Rome area, both as a solo singer and as member of a Beatles tribute band. Drummer Marcello Vento is a teacher and jazz musician.

   This is one of so many Italian bands that came to scene, released one album and then disbanded. That is a pity because it would have been nice to see how they managed to improve and create a second record, a third or a fourth one; now we'll never know. Albero Motore released "Il Grande Gioco" in 1974, an album whose music is not that traditional RPI sound, though it does have some traditional Italian folk rock moments. The album features seven songs and a total time of 35 minutes.

   The first song is entitled "Cristoforo Colombo", which is a very nice melody. Acoustic guitar with soft piano and nice raw vocals. Later a wind instrument, backing vocals and a pretty good guitar solo. The mood is enjoyable, like a nice rock and roll song with good piano moments, but nothing more. "La Esperienze Passate" is like the second part of the opener song, because it stars practically with the same music the first song ended. A minute later it stops, there is a violin for some seconds and later vocals, bass and drums appear. There are also some guitar sounds here and there. The rhythm is pretty simple, but anyway, enjoyable, catchy.

   "Una Vitta di Notte" starts with piano and vocals, seconds later it turns faster when drums appear. The music again is not bad, but it sounds like a conventional 60s rock band. It has some slices of bluesy moments, but the progressive element does not really exist. At half the song, there is a nice moment where piano takes the leadership. And the last part is very cool, in moments reminding me of The Rolling Stones.

   "Landru" has nice bass notes and a predominant piano sound, a very rockish piece of music with some funny vocals. Nice guitar riffs and good instrumentation. Their sound is pretty 60s, though it was released at mid-70s. "Israele" is a softer piece with nice chorus vocals that do remind me to some of the RPI bands, such as New Trolls in moments. But later the song changes and a voice (not the raw one) appear with a more delicate sound. The music seems to be simple, nothing difficult to play I mean, but sounds nice. This is actually one of the best, if not the best song here.

   "Nel Giardino dei Lillá" has acoustic guitars and harmonica accompanied by vocals. Seconds later drums and I believe it is a soft keyboard sound appears. This is a very catchy song, which can be both, listened or skipped. I mean it is not really transcendent. And the last song is "Capodanno 73'" which is a pretty nice track actually, a short but rich one. The music is quite enjoyable and here I would say the prog element does exist. The piano, drums, guitar and bass sound all together produce an excellent moment. There is also an acoustic guitar that reminds me to some of Cocciante's or Battisti's works. A nice song to end the album.
