   The 26-minute title suite (essentially a dissertation rationalizing why a Communist country should house an explicitly religious art artifact like Raphael’s Sistine Madonna, which was housed in an art museum in Dresden) was performed live at a youth festival in 1979. It’s a bombastic, Rick Wakeman-ish work, complete with choir and tons of synthesizers. That said, it’s a high point of their career, singer Manuel von Senden (nowadays living in Austria and working as an opera singer!) was never finer. Let down a bit on the B-side, though the ballad “Errinerung” is certainly lovely. The original Amiga Masters CD issue had as a bonus track “Über Feuer,” an old track from the Hallo-series days (and featuring original vocalist Stephan Trepte, then with Reform) with an explicit Jethro Tull fixation.

   after I have heard "Die Sixtinische Madonna" which is their fourt studio album I am overwhelmed. This is a fnatastic example of how startling a prog composition could be.

   I would compare the composition "Die Sixtinische Madonna" which other bands which have been inspired by classical music such as the Spanich "Los Canarios" or Italian "Premiata Forneria Marconi". Electra is a rock band which sounds like an orchestra and plays their rock music which excellent classical music in it. The main part of the album is the three-part track "Die Sixtinische Madonna" and that is the main reason to hear this album. In the start it reminds me of PFM's "L'Isola di Niente" and further they play only their own style of music. A rock opera with inspiration of symphonies, medieval music and rock of course. Sometimes we hear classical renaissance choir music but mostly we hear the magical strong German vocals of Bernd Aust and Manuel von Senden. Unfortunately my example of the record has quite bad sound, but it didn't obstruct me from enjoy it fully. The long piece by itself makes this a masterpiece

   "Scheindungstag" and "Jahrmarkt" are more typical German rock songs with a strong vibrant vocal and fine melodies and finally "Erinnerung" is a lovely closer with an honest melody and sweet vocals. If anyone has the opportunety to hear Electra's fourth they should because the world earns the right to hear it. The title track, if the sound quality is reasonable, is in the world class of prog. Not many prog bands come from German Democratic Republic but some do and I am glad I listened to this.
