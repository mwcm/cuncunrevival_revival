   The Pretty Things were one of the most underrated rhythm &amp; blues bands to come out of the mid-60's British rock explosion. So well-loved by Brits, they were often thought of in the same breath as The Rolling Stones. And, like a lot of great rhythm &amp; blues based groups to come put of England, they stepped somewhat uneasily into the precarious psychedelic music explosion. However, in all fairness, The Pretty Things did come up with a pretty fine and original album, Emotions. Superbly well-orchestrated (especially the gorgeous "The Sun," one of the album's standouts), The Pretty Things didn't lose sight of their R&amp;B leanings, as tracks such as "There Will Never Be Another Day" show. This reissue is also buttressed by a generous selection of bonus tracks seven of 'em - making it even more worthwhile.

   This album is the Pretty Things’ Between The Buttons. Great pop songs and it grows on you. I remember disliking the album at first because of the orchestrations which I still think are cheesy. But the songs are top notch, or first rate pop. One Long Glance, Photographer, and others are ones that come to mind. This album grows on you, so don’t write this one off. Mick Jagger once said in a Rolling Stone interview that he “didn’t like Between the Buttons much citing Back Street Girl as the exception, and Phil May hated this album at the time. The thing both Stones and Pretty Things albums have in common are bad production but these albums are links are between their blues period to their Psychedelic stuff. Both are wonderful transitions

   Emotions was the third Pretty Things album, and it was radically different from the previous two,  which were more or less typical British rhythm´n blues albums. On the second album “Get The Picture” they had already shown that they were very skilled songwriters, but with “Emotions” their musical ambitions led them into experiments with orchestral arrangements - or was it the record company that wanted to change their image?  The album has often been criticized for being ruined by these Reg Tilsley strings and brass arrangements.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I agree that on some tracks these “outside” instruments do remove focus from the band and their music, but actually I think the album has aged very well. This is also due to some fine songwriting and great vocals from Phil May.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Death of a Socialite” is a strong opener, great tune and vocals, and apart from the ending I think the arrangements works fine!
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The single “Children” is a great catchy psychedelic-type song, practically Pretty Things with no “outside” interference. It was a minor hit in Denmark, and remember it being played regularly on Danish Radio.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “The Sun” is a quiet ballad. A version without strings is added as a bonus-track, so you can compare which you prefer. Personally I think I prefer the original strings-version, but both are great.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   On “There Will Never be Another Day” the added instruments sound completely out of place; so it´s great that there is an undubbed version added. Probably one of the weakest tracks, though.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “House of Ten” is another fine quite number. The strings support the song discretely.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Out in the Night” is not among the best songs, and the brass, makes it a track that I prefer jumping over. it would have been interesting to have this song with the Pretty Things alone.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “One Long Glance” is untouched by Tilsley; a good song that could have been from “S.F. Sorrow”.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Growing in My Mind” is another fine ballad.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Photographer” is a Chuck Berry-type rocker; again the brass arrangement sound out of place, and again the “clean” version can be found among the bonus-tracks.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Unfortunately “Bright Lights of the City” cannot be found without orchestra. Could have been a much better track.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Tripping” is “untouched” and a good song, sounds a lot like early Rolling Stones.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The original closing track “My Time” is more or less spoiled by brass-overdubs; thankfully a version without them had been added.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Besides the undubbed “Emtions” tracks, two more single-tracks have been included. Their great cover of the Kinks´ “House in the Country” and their own minor hit-single “Progress”  - also in an alternate version.
