   Danny Joe Brown will always be remembered by his raspy voice that lifted hits like Flirtin’ With Disaster and Bounty Hunter to the charts while singing for Molly Hatchet. He was diagnosed with diabetes at an early age and battled with that disease all his life, but never the less, managed to rise to stardom, not only with Molly Hatchet, but with The Danny Joe Brown Band as well.

   Danny Joe Brown grouped with Steve Holland and lead guitarist David Hlubek and formed Molly Hatchet in early 70’s. They released two massively popular albums, but during the peak of their success, Danny Joe Brown continued to suffer from diabetes and was eventually forced to leave the band in 1980.

   In 1981, Brown released a solo album, which featured classic Edge of Sundown,  under the name Danny Joe Brown band, but the following year was asked to rejoin Molly Hatchet due to the unsuccessful result of the release of  their “Take No Prisoners” album.

   The Molly Hatchet band took a hiatus in 1985 but made a big comeback after four years with their album “Lightning Strikes Twice”, of course, still with Danny Joe Brown. Unfortunately, the album was not that successful and they decided to dissolve the band for good.

   On March 10, 2005, Danny Joe Brown died at the age of 54. Brown had been in hospitalized for the past few weeks prior to his death and died only day after returning his home in Davie, Florida.

   The Danny Joe Brown Band was formed in 1980 and kept its musical emphasis close to the original style that his former band, Molly Hatchet had originated. The Danny Joe Brown Band was centered around its lead singer, Danny Joe Brown and rest of the band consisted of Bobby Ingram (Guitar), Steve Wheeler (Guitar), Kenny McVay (Guitar), John Glavin(Keyboards), Buzzy Meekin(Bass) and Jimmy Glenn (drums).

   The band was signed to the same label that Molly Hatchet was on, Epic Records. It released its only self-titled album in 1981 which featured freebird-like hit Edge of Sundown, song that get still played on Molly Hatchet concerts to this day. Rest of the album was filled with the same old vocals that fans had come to know and love, and it took the Hatchet fans by storm.

   The Danny Joe Brown Band toured heavily to promote their new album, but to noticeably smaller crowds than Danny Joe had experienced with Molly Hatchet, although they were billed as the opening act for Blackfoot on that band’s highly successful Marauder tour in 1981. Danny Joe Brown replaced the entire band during the east coast leg of the band’s US tour from February through May 1982. The new members were a three-guitar line-up featuring Al Tuten, Jimmy Polston and Billy Poovey, bassist Ronnie Able, and drummer Shane Bressette.

   The Danny Joe Brown Band called it quits in 1982 soon after getting kicked out from the tour with Foghat, following Danny Joes attack on their tour manager. Danny Joe returned back to Molly Hatchet and stayed with them until his stroke in 1995.

   One of the most puzzling moves in the history of Southern rock occurred when vocalist Danny Joe Brown left Molly Hatchet after the huge success of 1979's Flirtin' with Disaster, one of the genre's definitive albums. He released one solo album on Epic, 1981's Danny Joe Brown and the Danny Joe Brown Band. It only scraped the bottom of the charts, and he wisely rejoined Molly Hatchet by 1982. This album is of interest to Southern rock fans because it should come as no surprise that it sounds like Molly Hatchet. Like Molly Hatchet, Brown's band also featured a three-guitar attack, courtesy of Bobby Ingram, Steve Wheeler, and Kenny McVay. A couple of extra musical touches support Brown's throaty growl: slide guitar riffing by Ingram and Wheeler, keyboard accents by John Galvin and harmony vocals that certainly must have been encouraged by producer/engineer Glyn Johns, a legend who'd worked with the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Eagles and Eric Clapton. The best tracks are "Sundance,""Nobody Walks on Me,""The Alamo,""Run for Your Life," and, in particular, "Edge of Sundown," a mythical guitar-driven epic springing directly from the loins of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" and the Outlaws'"Green Grass &amp; High Tides." But that's not a bad thing. "Edge of Sundown" also plays an important role in Molly Hatchet's convoluted history. Ingram and Galvin would go on to join and lead Molly Hatchet itself (keeping the band alive long after Brown retired due to poor health) and an acoustic version of "Edge of Sundown" is featured on the underrated 2001 album Kingdom of XII. Danny Joe Brown and the Danny Joe Brown Band doesn't contain any earthshaking surprises, but it will reliably please Southern rock fans.
