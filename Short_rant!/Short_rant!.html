  Hi guys (and gals)...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lately two things have been brought to my attention...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. That we slowly are approaching the 500,000 visits
  <br/>
  2. That about 10% of the download links are down
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So to celebrate that y'all keep coming here and al the cool stories and remarks you have shared with me, the moment we reach that 500,000 visits we will do two things to say thank you to you people....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Take a short break from posting new stuff for a week or two so that we can reupload the dead stuff, in case something was taken down because a complaint, then I will not risk reposting it. But all the rest should be up in a couple of weeks
  <br/>
  2. I really hope you will like this one... to at least have something of a celebration, When we reach the 500,000 I will post an album that I have never seen posted anywhere online and that I can count with the fingers of my hands the amount of visitors of this blog that ave ever heard this stuff... and I am sure it will rock your (weirdo) socks off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks a lot people!
  <br/>
