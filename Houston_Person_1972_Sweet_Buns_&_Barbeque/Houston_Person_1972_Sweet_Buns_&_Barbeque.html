  After Broken Windows, Empty Hallways Houston returned with Sweet Buns and Barbeque. Unlike previous albums, Sweet Buns and Barbeque comprised only cover versions. There were no Houston Person originals on Sweet Buns &amp; Barbeque. However, still, Prestige Records brought in some of the best musicians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pianist Richard Tee joined drummer Bernard “Pretty” Purdie, bassist Ron Carter and guitarist Joe Beck. Along with what seemed like a cast of thousands, they recorded the six songs that became Sweet Buns and Barbeque. It was released in 1973.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sweet Buns and Barbeque’s release in 1973, reviews ranged from mixed to favourable. However, Sweet Buns and Barbecue wasn’t as well received as the albums produced by Bob Porter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed the breakup of the Bob Porter and Houston Person partnership had affected Houston’s music. No longer was the music as groundbreaking. That, however, may not have been Houston’s fault. Maybe, Prestige Records were looking for music that was commercial? Sadly, we’ll never know. What we do know, is that Houston Person’s time at Prestige Records was almost at an end.
