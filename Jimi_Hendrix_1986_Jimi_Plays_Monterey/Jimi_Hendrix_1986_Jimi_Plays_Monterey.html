   In the evening of June 18th 1967, The Jimi Hendrix Experience played The Monterey International Pop festival, in between The Grateful Dead and The Mamas &amp; The Papas (who also had Scott McKenzie with them). The Who had played before The Grateful Dead and neither they nor Hendrix wanted to follow each other – for good reason as The Who were on guitar-smashing top form. As for The Jimi Hendrix Experience, they were virtually unknown in The States at that time. Like many of the artists that appeared at that festival that would not remain the case – in slightly less than 45 minutes, The Monterey International Pop Festival made their reputation.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   You will note that Monterey was not billed as a Rock Festival. It was very much a pop festival and the range of artists from Ravi Shankar to Otis Redding to Hugh Masekela to Jefferson Airplane to The Byrds to Lou Rawls to Simon &amp; Garfunkel to Johnny Rivers is quite staggering. Organised by John Phillips of The Mamas &amp; Papas and their producer, Lou Adler, with producer Alan Pariser and publicist, Derek Taylor,  Monterey is often overlooked when compared, say, to Woodstock but it was better organised, had better sound and probably better weather. It was held at the same venue as The Monterey Jazz &amp; Folk Festivals. The festival was filmed by D A Pennebaker – I have the film plus out-takes - and it is all great (although I can see why Simon &amp; Garfunkel did not make the final cut - their harmonies were way-off!).

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But back to The Jimi Hendrix Experience. The trio were Jimi Hendrix – guitar &amp; vocals, Noel Redding – bass &amp; backing vocals and Mitch Mitchell – drums and they were already a major attraction in the UK. Hendrix seemed to be enjoying himself  -  although nerves probably account for some of the mistakes – but from the opening of “Killing Floor” – (A Howlin’ Wolf song) to the closing “Wild Thing” where Hendrix upstages The Who by setting his guitar on fire (“A Sacrifice” as Hendrix puts it) you can tell that Jimi Hendrix was determined to make his mark. He wasn’t the only one – Monterey made stars of Janis Joplin, Laura Nyro, Canned Heat, Otis Redding (he was more or less unknown to white audiences), Canned Heat, The Steve Miller Band &amp; Ravi Shankar and enhanced the reputations of others.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I am not sure how this festival was so influential – The Beach Boys who were a “no-show” for many good reasons – never regained their reputation – not fully – but it was.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   But now I want to turn to the CD of The Jimi Hendrix Experience performance – no visuals – just the music. It is worth pointing out that the CD I have was released in October 2007. It was engineered by Eddie Kramer who worked as an engineer on all of the albums Hendrix made in his life-time and has looked after the Hendrix albums since The Hendrix family gained the rights to Hendrix’s material – the label is “Experience Hendrix” and while there has been definite barrel scrapping of late, “Live At Monterey” is pretty much essential. The same set was issued in February 1986, the earlier version being produced by Alan Douglas whose work on the posthumous Hendrix material has been heavily slatted. I have no idea if this CD sounds any different – I have not heard it but it has a different cover – a picture of a burning guitar and is called “Jimi Plays Monterey”. There is also an earlier release – from August 1970 – just a few weeks before Jimi Hendrix’s untimely death. This was a vinyl album called “Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival” and was produced by John Phillips &amp; Lou Adler. Side one was The Jimi Hendrix Experience – 4 tracks of the nine song set – “Like a Rolling Stone” – the Bob Dylan song, “Rock Me Baby” – the BB King blues standard, Jimi’s own “Can You Hear Me” and the previously mentioned “Wold Thing”. Side two consists of the five songs Otis Redding performed at the festival – Otis had to curtail his set but those five songs changed history – but that is another story. Of these, despite missing out the third verse (and Dylan when he performs “Like a Rolling Stone” tends to omit it) “Like a Rolling Stone” is stunning. – and the other three are not bad, either.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Back to the CD. Following the introduction by Brian Jones – and I can’t believe he flew out specially just to introduce The Jimi Hendrix Experience – the other songs consist of the three songs that had provided Jimi with UK hits – “Hey Joe”, “The Wind Cries Mary” &amp; “Purple Haze”  - all excellent as is “Foxy Lady” not a UK single but it was an American one. This was a set that was designed to sell Jimi Hendrix to an American audience. It certainly worked. The guitar playing is superb – no long solos here - as is Mitchell’s drumming. Redding’s bass was the weak link – but his playing was OK and suited Hendrix until the arrival of Billy Cox.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “Live at Monterey” is an historical document but it is still great music and it is worth buying for “Like a Rolling Stone”. The fact that the rest is great, too, is a bonus.
