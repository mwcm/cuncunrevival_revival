   Two years after his ethereal and groundbreaking release, 1967’s Duster, Burton released this jazz-rock classic. Duster was an album that carefully made the crossover while Good Vibes was a full-fledged dive into the rock and roll spectrum.

   With the distorted sounds of the electric vibes on "Vibrafinger", it is very difficult to ascertain what instrument is creating which sound. The tremendously underrated guitar playing of Eric Gale and Jerry Hahn also grace the album throughout. From the flamenco of "Las Vegas Tango" which is Clint Eastwood meets Milt Jackson on Haight Ashbury Street to the wailing blues of "Boston Marathon", these two cover every guitar style possible with Burton’s providing his own take on the styles as well. If the fusion work of Herbie Mann has any interest with you, then Gary Burton’s Good Vibes should be equally as appealing. They both took a relatively obscure jazz instrument and fused them masterfully with rock and roll. In

   addition, Herbie Mann often recruited the vibe work of Roy Ayers, who shared a similar technique and style as Burton. Good Vibes represented Burton’s sampling with the fusion, but he was equally known for his Cool, Latin and be-bop works. When Atlantic Records promoted the album in 1969, the used the slogan "Jazzmen Gone Rock". His touring band even further expanded on the rock and roll relationship by wearing casual clothes and wearing their hair wrong. Long before Miles Davis filled San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium, Gary Burton shared a bill at the venue with the Electric Flag and Cream and like some "Hendrixian ritual", the band would finish their live performances by piling their instruments at the center of the stage and solemnly departing.

   Surprisingly funky album from a famous vibist. Vibes are usually associated with smooth grooves, but here Gary Burton is accompanied by heavy groovers like Eric Gale, Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, Steve Swallow ... Half the tunes are funky originals: "Vibrafinger" (a real killer !), "Boston Marathon" (which begins slowly and grows on being almost as good and funky), "Leroy the Magician". There are 3 covers: Gil Evans'"Las Vegas Tango" ( small group version of a large band tune), and 2 down home Soul covers: Otis Redding's"Pain in My Heart" and Aretha's "I Never Loved a Man (the Way I Love You)". PS: all are instrumentals only.
