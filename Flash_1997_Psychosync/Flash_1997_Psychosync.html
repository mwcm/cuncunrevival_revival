  Review by Ms. Kate Shawon

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As you get older you realise that life can be so cruel, in not pointing out momentous events as and when they happen!

   When I went to see Flash at Manchester's late, lamented Stoneground, it was the first gig I attended after leaving home. I knew of Peter Banks as one of the founding members of young, prog-rock darlings, Yes ( yes they were actually young once!). Flash were brilliant from start to finish. Obviously Banks was the star but the bass player and the drummer more than held their own. Only real weak link was vocalist Colin Carter, with his irritating vibrato. He sounded like he would be more at home teaching geography in a minor public school, than flirting with rock stardom. I am hoping it was he, who was predominantly responsible for the wussy lyrics too!

   Peter Banks was a revelation! To this day I have not seen a more exciting guitar player and unless it is nostalgia tweaking my emotions, this should be apparent to anyone listening to this album. What set Banks apart from all the guitar greats I saw subsequently, was his love of simply playing guitar. I'm sure he enjoyed being famous for five minutes and I'm sure he would have enjoyed all the material trappings, which eventually fell to his Yes compatriots, as sustained fame led to personal wealth, but the sheer joy he obviously got from simply playing was something I have rarely encountered anywhere else. He was forever jumping around and pogoing (remember this was several years before punk) and he played his low slung Gibson 335, as if he was an urban guerilla brandishing an AK47! I was right at the front and at one point he jumped shoulder high and partly landed on me, saying "ever so sorry mate" and returning to the stage, having not dropped a single note! His ever frantic guitar playing frequently featured musical jokes and he was the first person I ever saw use a full pint of lager as a slide! Steve Howe, Banks's replacement in Yes may or may not have been, technically better than Pete, but his smug and self-conscious attempts to incorporate
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Banks's humour into his playing, as in 'The Clap', never quite cut the mustard for me.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Banks's general irreverence and laddish behaviour, made it pretty obvious why his tenure with Yes had been short and precarious, bearing mind the apparent studious and abstemious nature of the other members. I would say however that the original Yes, who made just two albums always did a lot more for me than subsequent incarnations.

   Some years after I was at this gig i embarked on a career in the music media, which meant that I met just about aeveryone who was anyone from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties. I became quite friendly with a number of 'rock stars' including subsequent member of Yes, Rick Wakeman, but I never met Peter Banks, which was a shame, because I'm sure I would have liked him a lot more than most (mind you he may well have thought I was a bit of a pr*t!)

   As I said at the beginning, sometimes you just don't realise how momentous an event is at the time. I never thought that Flash wouldn't stay the course and that they would be pretty much over in............well a flash! Even more tragic was the fact that I didn't stop to think that maybe Peter Banks wouldn't take his place at the very top of the tree of great rock guitarists. Fact was, from that day to this I've never seen Banks again and that to me, is a personal tragedy.

   I won't bore you with a track by track review as, if you're new to Flash, that wouldn't mean anything and if you're a fan you'll know them all anyway! All I will say is Flash are one of the great forgotten bands of progrock and this album captures them just as I remember them. The only reason for four stars is the sound quality which is variable (i suspect some of the tracks were bootlegs) and Colin Carter (sorry nothing personal Col). The booklet notes are written by Pete Banks and are amusing and enlightening.

   Peter Banks you are a giant amongst rock guitarists and you are still a legend to me and my contemporaries (including, I suspect to Plug Kaye, who was at the gig with me, but whom I haven't seen for over twenty years!)
