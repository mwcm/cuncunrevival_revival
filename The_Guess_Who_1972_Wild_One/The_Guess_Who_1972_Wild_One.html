  Wild One! is a compilation album by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who.[2] It features tracks recorded and originally released in Canada between 1965 and 1967, prior to their breakout US success with "These Eyes". This album features original lead singer Chad Allan on lead vocals for all tracks except for 6 &amp; 9, which are sung by Burton Cummings.

  Pickwick Records can boast having hired Lou Reed as a staff writer, and that his obscure "Cycle Annie" exists is a classic that can only be attributed to Pickwick, however, Wild One by the Guess Who is pretty much indicative of the cheap product the label was known for. Despite the washed-out bikini-clad gal on a hot car LP cover, an idea the Cars would refine for Candy-O, and the totally useless liner notes by Modern Hi Fi editor Robert Angus, this album has merits. Most notably a composition by Burton Cummings, "If You Don't Want Me," which sounds like Sky Saxon and the Seeds, is a real artifact! "Shot of Rhythm &amp; Blues" is as close to a clone of early Beatles as you'll find. Once you get over the motives behind the disc, and the packaging, what sounded dreadful upon release is historically sound decades later. Two of these titles appeared on Scepter Records' everpresent Shakin' All Over album by the Guess Who's Chad Allan &amp; the Original Reflections which boasted an equally cheesy cover of a guy and girl dancing in a room wallpapered with aluminum foil. "Don't Be Scared" is one of them. The heavy Beach Boys-style vocals are an embarrassment. The difference between the version on Scepter and the one on Pickwick is the sound quality. Wild One is "electronically enhanced for stereo," which doesn't make sense since the stereo masters surely must have been available. "Baby Feelin'" is written by Johnny Kidd who penned the first Guess Who hit, "Shakin' All Over," which put them on the map prior to Jack Richardson betting the house on "These Eyes," and winning. "Baby Feelin'" opens with that Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates riff "Shakin' All Over" made famous, but this version would make Roky Ericson smile. Vintage '60s stuff. Jim Kale, longtime bassist for the band, composed " I Want You to Love Me" and at least the spirit here is better than All This for a Song, which was Kale's post-Cummings version of the Guess Who. In fact, if All This for a Song contained these attempts at copping British Invasion riffs -- flavors stolen from the Beatles'"There's a Place" -- it may have sold a few copies.
