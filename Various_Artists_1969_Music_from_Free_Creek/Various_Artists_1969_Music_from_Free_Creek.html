  The recordings, made in 1969, were released in 1973 in England as CADS 101 by Charisma Records and in the U.S. by Buddah Records, as a two-record set. The material was re-released by Charisma in 1976, as Summit Meeting. It was released on CD by Lake Eerie Records in 2002, and re-released by the same company in 2006. The 2006 CD states on its inlay card Digitally Remastered, but there is no other information to support this claim - the CD states only 1973 as production date, with 2006 added as a copyright date.

  I don't know what was the genesis of this project. The liner notes on the CD and the original vinyl release provide two seemingly preposterous sounding scenarios as to what happened, but one is really true. Sessions like these were commonplace and may have been an offshoot of the plethora of festivals and the feeling of music being the common bond, that good music will come out of these sessions, using musicians from very disparate backgrounds (rock, country, blues, big band, pop - all on the same track). Kinda like what the original idea of progressive rock was intended to be. But, these recordings should not be construed as making this a progressive rock record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the most part, the music here has a laid back feel. The musicians are certainly of high caliber, but seemed to have been invited to do a jam session. There is not much polish here and that is the attraction to this release. You have nice vocals by Linda Ronstadt during her country phase of her career. You have credible performances by Keith Emerson, Todd Rundgren, Harvey Mandel, Doctor John, Delaney Bramlett and Jeff Beck with the pseudonym of A.N. Other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is a great release to just kick back and listen to. It is not music to take seriously or to analyze. It is pleasant music to enjoy and that may be the whole reason for this music when originally released - just enjoy it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Given the pedigree of talent, you would have thought that this record would have been heavily marketed. It wasn't for whatever reason and quickly found it's way to the cut-out bins, where I found my copy. Don't wait till that happens again. It went out of print quickly and it may do it again just as quick.
