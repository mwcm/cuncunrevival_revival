   Formed by Cesar Banana Pueyrredon (b. in Buenos Aires, 1952), BANANA play a somewhat typical symphonic prog with a strong emphasis on guitar and vocals. The youngest of eight children, Cesar's rather timid disposition prompted him to take refuge in piano playing. He took lessons, attended the Catholic University (Argentina) and got together with brothers and friends for a few jams. Eventually, they decided to take on the name BANANA and in 1979, they released an album which boasted honourable sales in South America (Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama).

   Their album, entitled "Aun Es Tiempo De Sonar", is at times very good, at times quite average prog. The music shows a variety of influences ranging from YES to NEKTAR, FOCUS, KAIPA, GENESIS and CAMEL. Though their sound is very melodic and the guitar most prominent, the rhythm section is pretty basic and the keyboards (mostly Fender Rhodes) are usually relegated to the background. As for the vocals, they are fairly abundant but sound rather AORish, or crooner style, if you like. What this album lacks is perhaps a little Latin flair - something similar to what their fellow countrymen ESPIRITU do. This definitely would give their material a bit more punch and originality.

   Don't get braked by the band title or unexpressive album cover, relax and taste this BANANA; the music in "Aun es tiempo..." is simply beautiful, delicate, dreamy, uplifting, peaceful and emotional 1st class symphonic prog.

   Mainly influences are YES, GENESIS or even some melodic FOCUS, but what keeps more rejoicing is the own band melodic Argentina expression. Yeah, the music is more in accessible side, probably not requiring repeated listens to grow on like more adventure Argentina bands such as ALAS, MIA, BU BU, even so I highly recommend "Aun es tiempo..." as the proposal is perfectly reached, I mean the mood is in heart beauty art realm; to get pretty convincing is this field, is also a gift.

   "Aun es tiempo de sonar" is a jewel; you have masterly placed organ, moog, ARP, electric piano by the band leader Cesar Pueyrredon (compositions comes from him) and his voice and chorus band are stellar (yeah sometimes his vocal interpretation talent can fit to AOR or popish side). Guitars comes in precise measure. Compositions are coherent and tight.

   This BANANA can be compared with PABLO EL ENTERRADOR, but has the advantage of having perfect 70's studio sound production while the last suffers with sonic problems. The authentic south American melodic emotion can also be compared with the Venezuela masterpiece ESTRUCTURA "Mas alla?", but "Aun es tiempo?" is overall a more coherent album.
