   This was a live album to showcase Blue Note's more contemporary sound they were releasing around this time. The artists chosen to showcase this sound were Carmen McRae, Alphonse Mouzon, Ronnie Laws, Earl Klugh and Donald Byrd. Most of this is pretty bland renditions of what were good studio recordings; in particular Ronnie Laws embarrassingly weak version of "Always There", but the saviour of the show is Donald Byrd who does storming versions of "Places &amp; Spaces" and "Dominoes". Also, there's a previously unheard track called "Blue Note '76" which is a total funk monster. This is performed by The Blue Note All Stars, who among others consist of Gene Harris, George Bohannon, and Bobby Hutcherson. I suupose with them three in the ingredients you're bound to end up with a pretty heavy gumbo.
