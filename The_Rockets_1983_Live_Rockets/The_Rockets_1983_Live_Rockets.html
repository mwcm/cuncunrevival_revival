   Detroit Rock City boasts an impressive rock &amp; roll pedigree that includes ALICE COOPER, BOB SEGER, MC5, RARE EARTH, TED NUGENT and BROWNSVILLE STATION. LIVE ROCKETS is a slam-bang grab bag of boogie classics from that region's most underrated band, whose five album career has otherwise never been legitimized by a greatest hits compilation. DAVE GILBERT's raspy, "party boy" screech is bolstered by ex-DETROIT WHEELS legends JIM MCCARTY's careening axe salvos and JOHNNY "THE BEE" BADANJEK's solid stick-work. The core band is augmented by guest sax blower CHUCK PERRAUT and a trio of soul-powered female backing vocalists...this is a made-loud-to-play-loud farewell party with equal parts class, trash, and sass. Crash 'n burn BADENJEK originals like CAN'T SLEEP, TURN UP THE MUSIC and ROLLIN' BY THE RECORD MACHINE mix seamlessly with a suitably funky cover of LOU REED's slinky SALLY CAN'T DANCE and a ballbustin' version of bloozer PETER GREEN's classic OH WELL. As one of their album titles suggested, there are NO BALLADS to get in the way of a good time. Brash, bloozey, and bawdy, once you give 'em a ride, LIVE ROCKETS is a hard platter indeed to take off your record machine
