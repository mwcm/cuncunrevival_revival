  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Emitt Rhodes, who was a rising pop star in the early 1970s, with songwriting and singing skills likened to those of Paul McCartney, then gave up performing for more than 40 years, becoming a cult figure among musicians, died July 19 at his home in Hawthorne, Calif. He was 70.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The death was confirmed by Chris Price, a musician who produced Mr. Rhodes’s 2016 comeback album, “Rainbow Ends.” He did not know the specific cause.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes was something of a prodigy of pop music, playing in bands by 14 and signing his first major-label contract at 16, when he was with the group Merry-Go-Round.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   By 19, he had become a solo performer, writing all of his songs, playing all the instruments and producing the recordings in a shed in his backyard — practically creating the idea of the home studio.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   His self-titled debut album from 1970, which showed Mr. Rhodes on the cover moodily peering through a scorched windowpane, led a critic for Billboard to call him “one of the finest artists on the music scene today.” The album reached No. 29 on the Billboard charts, and one of its singles, “Fresh as a Daisy,” topped out at No. 54.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The music was bright, catchy and meticulously arranged, and Mr. Rhodes’s soaring tenor voice invited immediate comparisons with McCartney. Rumors began to circulate that “Emitt Rhodes” was a pseudonym for McCartney or that the Beatles had recorded an unreleased album that was appearing under a made-up name; others speculated that the recently broken-up Beatles were working incognito as Mr. Rhodes’s backup band.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When it became apparent that Mr. Rhodes was playing the parts of John, Paul, George and Ringo — and their producer, George Martin — all by himself, he was dubbed the “one-man Beatles.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “It was really flattering,” the very real Mr. Rhodes told The Washington Post in 2002. “Those guys were my idols.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A second album, “Mirror,” appeared in 1971, and Mr. Rhodes — slender, clean-shaven and darkly handsome in those days — toured the country, seemingly on his way to stardom.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “I was chased, I had underwear thrown at me, I had groupies,” he told The Post. “It was like being in ‘A Hard Day’s Night.’ ”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 1973, Mr. Rhodes released the aptly titled “Farewell to Paradise,” his somewhat disillusioned goodbye to the life of a budding rock star. He was 23.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When he had agreed to his record deal with the Dunhill label four years earlier, Mr. Rhodes was required to produce a new album every six months for three years. Moreover, he had signed away the royalty rights to his songs “in perpetuity.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Busy writing the songs, singing, playing all the instruments and producing polished little power-pop gems, Mr. Rhodes fell behind the schedule dictated by his contract. His record company withheld his royalties and sued him for $250,000 — “more money than I’d ever seen,” Mr. Rhodes later said. “I was horribly confused.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   He fell silent. He stopped writing music and went through personal problems, which he said included depression, drinking, drugs and divorce. The backyard studio went unused.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes spent the next 30 years working as a staff engineer and producer with Elektra and other recording studios. Nonetheless, his music endured, even as his mystery grew.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “He was a deep, deep cult figure,” said filmmaker Tony Blass, who interviewed Mr. Rhodes for a 2009 Italian-produced documentary, “The One Man Beatles.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the 1980s, the all-female band the Bangles recorded Mr. Rhodes’s “Live,” which he had written and performed on television at 17. Other musicians hailed him as a lost musical hero, a misunderstood pop genius not unlike Brian Wilson, the troubled leader of the Beach Boys — who had grown up blocks away from Mr. Rhodes in Hawthorne, a working-class Los Angeles suburb.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   A more apt comparison might be with songwriter Tandyn Almer, who wrote the 1966 hit “Along Comes Mary” for the Association and contributed to some Beach Boys songs before living his final years in obscurity in a basement apartment in Northern Virginia.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In 2001, director Wes Anderson — on a suggestion from actor Jason Schwartzman — used one of Mr. Rhodes’s songs, the wistful “Lullabye,” in the movie “The Royal Tenenbaums.” When Mr. Rhodes saw the movie with his 10-year-old daughter, he heard the words he had written in 1970:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tears that angels cry
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   And they darken all the sky
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When the one you love says goodbye
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “I’d forgotten the tune,” he told The Post, but added, “My little girl was proud of me.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Because of the contract he signed as a teenager, Mr. Rhodes did not see any royalties from “Lullabye” or any of his other songs. Eventually, new agreements were worked out, allowing him to profit from his earlier work.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The 2009 documentary about Mr. Rhodes received several awards in Europe and helped raise his profile. He also became friends with musician Chris Price, who knocked on Mr. Rhodes’s door in 2007 and began to meet him for lunch.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes gave Price, now with the group Bebopalula, musical pointers but refused to discuss his earlier life. There had been occasions in the 1980s and 1990s when record labels tried to bring Mr. Rhodes back to the studio, but the plans always fell through.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Eventually, he warmed up to Price and showed him manila folders containing more than 20 new songs. Many of them, such as “What’s a Man to Do,” were marked by a mature, wounded lyricism:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I hear the whispers
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I hear the talk
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I count the minutes
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I watch the clock
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I fear she’s leaving
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Won’t change her mind
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The door is closing
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I’m out of time
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Price convinced Mr. Rhodes that it was time to sing again. The old studio, which had shag carpet from the 1970s and was being used as a storage shed, was cleaned out and put back in service.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Musicians who had long revered Mr. Rhodes were brought in, including guitarist Jason Falkner, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr. and drummer Joe Seiders, with special appearances by singers Aimee Mann and Susanna Hoffs. Mr. Rhodes was back in his element, his voice as expressive as it had been in his youth.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes’s first album in 43 years, “Rainbow Ends,” appeared to glowing reviews in 2016.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “He wouldn’t put his name on just anything,” Price said in an interview. “We went through every song, every chord, every bar.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Emitt Lynn Rhodes was born Feb. 25, 1950, in Decatur, Ill., and moved with his family to Hawthorne at age 4. His father was a machinist, his mother a homemaker.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes was interested in music from an early age and began his career as a drummer in a band with friends from his high school. By 16, he was the lead guitarist and singer for Merry-Go-Round, penning the minor hit “You’re a Very Lovely Woman,” along with “Live.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “I wouldn’t call him a perfectionist,” Price said of Mr. Rhodes’s songwriting style. “I would say he had very keen instincts and seemed to know what would make a listener respond to a song emotionally.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Perhaps a more lasting influence, however, was Mr. Rhodes’s single-minded dedication to his craft, exemplified by his professional-quality home studio.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “He was a home recording guy before anybody else was doing it,” Price said. “He made it so that you couldn’t distinguish something he made from something made at Capitol Records. He did something out of necessity to him that later became commonplace.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   “This has fundamentally changed the way music is made.”
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Mr. Rhodes’s marriages to Kathy Sharp and Charnelle Smith ended in divorce. Survivors include his fiancee, Valerie Eaton of Toronto; two sons from his first marriage; and a daughter from his second marriage.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   After releasing his 2016 album, Mr. Rhodes seemed to have decided he had nothing more to say. He canceled a comeback appearance scheduled at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, choosing to stay at home in Hawthorne, in the same house he had lived in for decades. In the title track of “Rainbow Ends,” he sang:
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I wanna be somewhere far away
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Somewhere where I won’t be afraid
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I wanna be sheltered safe and warm
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   I wanna be somewhere far from harm.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="text-align: left;">
    The Merry-Go-Round were formed in Los Angeles during the summer of 1966 when Palace Guard drummer Emitt Rhodes left that band and began rehearsing in the Rhodes family garage with his high-school buddy Gary Kato. After a couple weeks with friends Mike Rice and Doug Harwood on bass and drums, respectively, the duo hooked up with a couple of L.A. movers: bassist Bill Rinehart had played in the Leaves and drummer Joel Larson with the Grass Roots, and both had been in the short-lived Gene Clark Group in 1966 and later played on Clark's classic 1967 album, Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers. Rhodes, Kato, Rinehart, and Larson recorded demos that attracted label attention and led to a deal with A&amp;M. "Live" was released as a single in early 1967 and quickly became a huge hit in L.A., and eventually reached number 63 in the Billboard singles chart. The B-side, "Time Will Show the Wiser," became somewhat well known too, as Fairport Convention cut a version on their 1968 debut album.
   </span>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Their next single, the highly arranged and orchestrated "You're a Very Lovely Woman," didn't fare as well on the charts, hitting only number 90 in late 1967. A&amp;M perhaps sensed that the window of opportunity was closing for the group and hastily released The Merry-Go-Round in November of 1967. The album, excellent though it is, consists of the singles, their flip sides, and assorted demos. The record stalled out at number 190 and Rinehart left the band soon after. He was replaced by Rick Dey, who had been with San Francisco band the Vejtables and also the Wilde Knights (the group that cut the original "Just Like Me," which Dey wrote and Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders later had a big hit with). The Merry-Go-Round released two singles in 1968, "Listen, Listen"/"Missing You" and "Highway"/"'Til the Day After," but neither hit and they soon found that fewer fans were drawn to their shows and offers to play were drying up. After plans to release a second album dissipated, Rhodes disbanded the Merry-Go-Round in 1969 and began working on solo material.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   His first album, The American Dream, contained solo tracks cut with session musicians as well as a few studio-sweetened Merry-Go-Round demos. Rhodes went on to release a handful of critically acclaimed solo albums, most notably the amazing Emitt Rhodes album from 1970. Gary Kato later formed Bullet and became a member of the group Derek, which had a hit with the bubblegum classic "Cinnamon." Rick Dey went on to do session work (including a stint working for the Monkees), recorded an album in the early '70s with his brother Tony and Barry Melton (of Country Joe &amp; the Fish fame), and passed away in 1973. In 2005 reissue label Rev-Ola released Listen, Listen: The Definitive Collection, which rounded up all the group's recordings and paired them with Rhodes' The American Dream.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Merry-Go-Round's self-titled 1967 album is a breathtaking blend of chiming folk-rock guitars, British Invasion harmony vocals, baroque pop arrangements, and pure pop songcraft that sounds daisy fresh in 2005. The Beatles are a huge influence, and there is plenty of McCartney in Emitt Rhodes' sweet vocals and their vocal harmonies. You can hear the Byrds a bit, some Left Banke (especially on the sweeping orchestral pop gem "You're a Very Lovely Woman"), some L.A. garage on rockers like "Where Have You Been All My Life" and "Lowdown"; the group definitely didn't exist in a vacuum. But there are some songs that are quite unique and original like "Time Will Show the Wiser" with its otherworldly sped up and backward guitars and enchanting melody, the bouncy and warm hit single "Live," and "Had to Run Around," an exquisite ballad whose tender beauty foreshadows Rhodes' classic 1970 Emitt Rhodes album. These songs, and the overall quality of the songs and the group's loose and earthy playing, help lift the album above the pack and should lead to it being mentioned in the same breath as Love's first album or Buffalo Springfield's first when talking about classic American debut albums of the '60s.
