   The description of the track "Turiya &amp; Ramakrishna" in the liner notes of Ptah, the El Daoud contains a quote from Alice Coltrane - "It's more a feeling than a melody" - which actually describes the music on the album as a whole. And yet it's far from the unfocused avant-garde haze such an assertion (as well as the presence of Pharoah Sanders) may seem to indicate; though never sharply defined - and excepting a few rambling missteps outside the realm of tonal structure during the vastness of the title track and "Mantra" - the music is honed and performed with the utmost kinetic congruence. Coltrane's music achieves its dynamic goals by channeling some of the most expressive and empathic players ever to wield instruments in Sanders, Joe Henderson, Ron Carter, and Ben Riley. The overall result is a captivating and indeed transcendent musical experience.

   The afore mentioned "Turiya" and "Blue Nile" stand out as the shorter, more buoyant pieces sandwiched between the other two haunting epics. "Turiya" is a completely unique piece built around Coltrane's equally unique piano style; she tends to play a keyboard much the way she plays the harp, eschewing root chords for tight clusters of arpeggiated notes, and on this song she manages to wrap this around an exquisite blues form. The harp is only utilized on the album in "Blue Nile", providing an illustrious backdrop for the quiet musings of Carter and the saxophonists. Sanders sounds especially piquant in this somewhat restrained setting, though he compromises none of his intensity along with the volume. And Henderson, as soulful as they come yet not as obvious a choice as others perhaps more in Coltrane's (or Impulse's) more immediate musical circle, was an excellent personnel selection for Ptah.

   Moreso than sequences of notes from respective instruments, what one hears and assimilates throughout this music is the individuals themselves who play it; designed within the ultimate statement and vision of Alice Coltrane is the opportunity for the soloists and even the rhythm players to filter their own spirits through it. Even as one may have no use for Coltrane's (or her husband's) underlying mysticism, there is no denying this magnificent spiritual quality that earmarks the best of her music. Seldom did it attain such heights as on Ptah, the El Daoud

   The word avant-garde is simply a term for the “leftovers” of music that don't fit neatly into any category. Given the breadth of experimental possibilities, it is rather meaningless by definition in conveying any prior sense of what to expect before actually hearing a new musical piece. Such is the case for ALICE COLTRANE and her masterpiece PTAH THE EL DAOUD (Ptah is an Egyptian God and El Daoud simply means The Beloved.) This sounds absolutely nothing like many of the other jazz artists lumped into the avant-garde such as Eric Dolphy, Sun Ra etc. Upon first listen it seems to me that Alice simply created something in the jazz world that is similar to what emerged in the rock world that later become known as post-rock, meaning rock instrumentation focused on ambiance and soundscapes rather than preordained musical compositions. ALICE COLTRANE does just that. It is clearly jazz by the sounds of the saxes and flutes, yet it's like the scarab beetle that graces this beautiful album cover. Alice's musical vision is the soft spiritually-infused fleshy part on the inside and the jazz instrumentation is the hard exoskeleton giving it a form. Just like post-rock, this post-jazz has additional instruments not usually heard in jazz. In this case the harp played with full virtuosity by Alice herself. And a super satisfying performance I may add.

   This album is just brilliant! It is a return to the modal jazz composition of the previous decade that was quickly being abandoned for a more fusion approach in the jazz world, yet it wasn't just being retrospective. It was also fresh and original taking jazz to new places. At times the piano reminds me more of soul or gospel adding a warmth and a gentleness to the ferociousness of the musical performance that feels like a battle between order and chaos and at times it truly does have a free-jazz feel especially when Pharoah Sanders and Joe Henderson are competing on the left and right channels with their saxophones. The free form performances of bassist Ron Carter and drummer Ben Riley show that it really is the sum of the parts that make this album come together. None of the individual instruments would sound right without the contrast. The strange thing about this album is that despite feeling like a mystical spiritual journey the music doesn't particularly evoke any feel towards the Ancient Egyptian imagery depicted on the cover art. Doesn't matter a bit though. I find this music satisfying from beginning to end and wishing more albums of the sort had been made like it. However, I guess that would diminish from its uniqueness.
