   Chet Baker Sextet features tracks recorded by trumpeter Chet Baker in 1954 and 1957 for the Pacific Jazz label and released over the years on various albums, including the original Playboys date. These are stellar "West Coast"-style tracks reminiscent of the small group work Baker did with saxophonist Jerry Mulligan and featuring first class arrangements by Jack Montrose and Bob Zieff. However, the Zieff cuts feature an unusual for the period chamber-style group with French horn, bassoon, cello, bass clarinet, and bass. The result was softly angular and very modern for the time. Interestingly most of the tracks have remained largely unavailable until this collection. While there are far more influential Baker albums from the '50s, Sextet is a beautiful album and a must-hear for Baker aficionados.

   My initial introduction to Chet Baker was via one of his many "Sings" albums and it was an immediate turn off. So for years despite the critical acclaim, I neglected a true jazz masterpiece like "Chet." Well I have since come around to enjoy some of his efforts, including the fine discs he made for the Pacific label with Gerry Mulligan and Art Pepper, and this recently reissued title "Sextet." Tracks 1-8 comprising the original LP are from two September 1954 sessions featuring Chet on trumpet, Bob Brookmeyer on valve trombone, Bud Shank on baritone sax, Russ Freeman on piano, Carson Smith on bass and Shelly Manne on drums. The selections are arranged by Jack Montrose, Johnny Mandel or Bill Holman, and needless to say the playing is tight! The remaining four tracks come from a "lost" December 1957 date featuring a drumless unit of Baker, Jimmy Buffington on French horn, Gene Allen on bass clarinet, Bob Tricarico on bassoon, Seymour Barab on cello and Russ Savakus on bass. Pianist Bob Zieff arranged these modern jazz chamber works, and they are quite interesting. In all, after hearing solid albums like this one by Chet Baker, I am happy to finally "sing" his praises.
