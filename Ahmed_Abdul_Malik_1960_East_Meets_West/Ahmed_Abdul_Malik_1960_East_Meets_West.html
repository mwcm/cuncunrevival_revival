   Very hard to classify, but very enjoyable. A lot of this record sounds like the compositions of a modern Arabic musician using traditional instruments. The sound harkens more back to the past than the future with beautiful, evocative, sensual music with underpinning drones at time and haunting violin. Only "La Ibky" seems to fit better within the jazz world than somewhat outside of it. However, on many of the pieces here, including the opening and closing numbers, powerful horns solo over this traditional underpinning, creating an almost psychedelic and potent affect. Other pieces keep to a more classical Arabic sound.  "Mahawara" sounds like a hymn from a Sufi order with a mystical Islamic vocal that accompanies its trance-like rhythms. It would be interesting to take this sound a step further in other directions. As it is, it's quite a powerful record.

   A brilliant mix of jazz and world music! Abdul-Malik was the legendary bass player from the fifties who mixed straight jazz playing with traditional Middle Eastern rhythms – and although he most famously recorded albums with Monk as a regular bassist, his albums on his own are amazing blends of jazz and world music, done years before anyone else had contemplated doing so! This album is similar to Abdul-Malik's Jazz Sahara album, in which he plays quite a bit on the Oud – but in this one the ensemble is much more jazz-oriented, and features Lee Morgan, Curtis Fuller, Benny Golson, and Johnny Griffin. The Oud holds center stage on most tracks, but then it drops out, and Morgan and Griffin come wailing in on solos that will rip your socks off!
