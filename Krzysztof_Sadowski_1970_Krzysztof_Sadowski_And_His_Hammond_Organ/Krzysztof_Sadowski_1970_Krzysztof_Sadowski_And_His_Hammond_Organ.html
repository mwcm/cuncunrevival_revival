   Krzysztof Sadowski born in Warsaw, Poland December 15, 1936. He studied piano for eleven years while at school and after graduating from the Warsaw Institute of Technology took up a career in jazz (1957). In the early 1960s he played and recorded with Zbigniew Namyslowski's Jazz Rockers and Jan Wr√≥blewski's Jazz Outsiders (both 1961-2), and worked with Andrzej Kurylewicz and the Swingtet led by the alto saxophonist Jerzy Matuszkiewicz. He achieved considerable success with his own group Bossa Nova Combo (from 1963), with which he toured the USSR (1965) and Scandinavia (1967).

   In 1967, influenced by Jimmy Smith, he took up the Hammond organ and formed a hard-bop ensemble, the Organ Group. He also toured and recorded with his wife, the pop singer and flutist Liliana Urbanska. Sadowski has composed many popular hits in Poland, as well as music for films, theater, radio, and television, and two suites, On the Cosmodrome (recorded on Na Kosmodromie, 1972, Muza 7048) and Our Common World. Long time activist and executive of Polish Jazz Society.

   The late 1960's ice rink feel of the first side is absolutely addictive, and the big payoff here. And that Beatles medley is (against all odds) actually very cool. Usually I tend to dislike that sort of thing, but imagine : a Beatles medley played on a cranky Hammond organ and a drum kit (only), recorded live with plenty of atmosphere and cool natural reverb to it.. and it almost sounds like ELP doing it, if Keith Emerson were actually blind drunk.. cracking !

   Tons of quirkiness to savour all over the LP (although the second (jazzier) side isn't quite as great as the first), this is the kind of "borderline easy listening" stuff that's actually really quite nice.

   This is the first album on the legendary Polish Jazz series, which is dedicated to the Hammond organ, the godfather of the electronic keyboards and probably the most significant new instrument, which dominated Jazz and Progressive Rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s (although available since the 1930s). Keyboardist Krzysztof Sadowski belongs to the first post WWII generation of Polish Jazz musicians, debuting in the 1950s and active on the local scene for many years. He combined his love of Jazz and Rock, playing with the leading ensembles of both genres with equal dedication and success. This album presents his Hammond organ performances in two different environments: Side A of the original LP captures him accompanied just by drummer Andrzej Dabrowski and the duo moves through a Rocky set, which includes a Beatles medley. Side B finds him accompanied by the Polish Radio Jazz Studio Orchestra, led by saxophonist / composer Jan "Ptaszyn" Wroblewski and featuring top Polish Jazz players, among them saxophonist Janusz Muniak, bassist Bronislaw Suchanek, drummer Janusz Stefanski and many others. This set is much closer to Jazz and features a beautiful version of Krzysztof Komeda's ballad from "Rosemary's Baby".
