   Issued in 1968, Why Not? is Marion Brown's second outing for the ESP label as a leader. The saxophonist also guested on a Burton Greene date earlier that same year. Featuring pianist Stanley Cowell, Coltrane alumnus Rashied Ali (Coltrane had been dead less than a year at this time), and bassist Norris Sirone Jones, Brown reveals his great strengths as a composer and bandleader, which are matched by his abilities as a soloist. The opener, "La Sorella," features a gorgeous opening solo by Cowell. Using large and intricate chorded modal phrases, Cowell creates a virtual chromatic field for the rest of the rhythm section -- Jones, in particular, responds in kind with scintillating three-string figures that add a deeper series of conical figures for ballast. Brown enters just behind Ali in full cry on the alto. Using a Coltrane-esque song figure to respond to Cowell's stunningly beautiful foundation, Brown blows lean but long lines before a long solo by Jones cuts them all quiet. When the band enters, they are in prelude form, with spun-out piano lines ever in anticipation and Brown calling something out of the ether that never quite materializes, which is fine because on "Fortunata" it does: a ballad that develops into something wholly other without changing tempo. This is jazz as expressionism; it doesn't need to be "free" because it has been untethered from the opening bars. Brown's solo here lilts on the branches of Cowell's arresting, nearly Debussian chromatic figures that extend harmonic ranges almost without end. By the time the band gets to the title track, a free workout in a dizzying tempo, the listener is grounded enough in Brown's composed lyricism so as not to be surprised at all when the fury of the tempo is elongated by the temperance in tension the band creates. Finally, on "Homecoming," where the ballad begins to show its face once more, each member steps in to underline and deconstruct it by using contrapuntal lyricism as a contrast. Even Ali, one of the great powerhouse drummers, dances rather than sprints around the band, even in his lengthy solo. This is a phenomenal album, a place where Marion Brown got to reveal early on why he was such a formidable force: He understood the inherent importance of musical traditions and he also understood how imperative it was to them and to jazz to extend them in a manner that left their roots clearly visible.

   Originally released in 1968, Why Not? is one of three ESP-Disk’ recordings on which alto-sax player Marion Brown appears. His first for ESP was recorded in 1965, the same year he worked with John Coltrane on Ascension. With the late bassist Norris “Sirone” Jones, pianist Stanley Cowell, and the late drummer Rashied Ali, Brown creates music that juxtaposes elegant fluidity with a determined starkness.

   Starting with “La Sorrella,” Brown floods his alto with a pure tonality that pervades the melodics of the remaining music. The piano sounds harp-like as it progresses in and out of chordal arrays; Sirone’s pizzicatos are soft, climbing and repetitive; and Ali maintains a predominately cymbal-ticking pulse.

   The ballad, “Fortunato,” features a glowing interlude from the piano that weaves webs of heavenly phrasing, as Ali brushes and accents the skins in the background. The alto sings beautifully, seeming out of context with vanguard jazz; but given the recording date of the album, this music can now be understood as predicting a timeless future.

   The last half of the record takes off in quick tempos. Brown energizes the title track with arpeggios that stay in mid-register, but launch easily into the high. Sirone moves through fast-paced pizzicatos; Ali demonstrates his smart stick work within a channel of exploration. A drum roll begins the last track, “Homecoming,” with a strangely slow entrance to the alto’s repeated pronouncement of a march-like theme. The group pursues that theme in multiple directions; the piano, at first, engaging the keyboard in incessant chord phrasings, some bordering on stride. The alto’s trumpet-like, staccato playing hints once at the tune, “Three Blind Mice.” Ali drives the drum set with a continuous variegated sound to usher in the reprise of the theme. The quartet closes with one swift tight swipe at brightness.

   Excellent, if occasionally inconsistent, free jazz

   This is a quartet recording for the ESP label with alto player Marion Brown accompanied by rhythm section consisting of Stanley Cowell on piano, Norris Jones on bass and Rashied Ali on drums.

   The opening tune is an extended, open improvisations section. It is more cohesive than most free jazz that was being recorded at the time, but much less structured than most of the post-bop of the time. It reminds me of the first 30 seconds of A Love Supreme, but stretched out into almost 10 minutes. The whole thing feels like it's leading up to something, and finally in the last two minutes of the piece, the tune turns into an odd dance-like melody. It's an interesting effect, but to me this track felt like eating a sandwich that was 90% lettuce and 10% meat. "Fortunato" begins with a mournful melody, that quickly breaks into loose improv, beginning with an impressionistic, harmonically rich piano solo, punctuated with Ali's busy brushwork on the drums. When Brown joins in the improv he adds a melodic element to the already interesting harmonic landscape. Again, the Coltrane influence is strong. A problem I had with both of the first two tunes is that they both stop right in the middle for bass solos that really felt unnecessary and slowed down the motion of the music.

   The title track is an exciting bit of improvisation on a loose theme that the band pounds out. It works well because of Rashied Ali's energetic playing. It gives all the soloists a very wide canvas on which to play, but it injects the whole thing with a sense of energy that the soloists find it easy to match. "Homecoming" has a definite feeling of being based on some kind of dance theme, but it sounds as if the dancers are drunk. It's a very cool effect. What's even cooler is when Cowell bursts into his piano solo with what sounds like a disjointed, perverted version of ragtime. Fantastic. The solo moves further into abstract territory but keeps coming returning, or at least hinting, at that ragtime feel. Definitely an album highlight.

   By 1968 free jazz was in full swing, and Marion Brown had already proven to be comfortable playing in very chaotic free situations. This album finds him taking a step back from the chaotic, dissonant version of free playing, that was popular at the time, and playing a slightly more structured, more subtle, (and in my opinion, more mature) version of free jazz. At times the music seems to lack direction slightly, and there are several instances where bass solos bring the energy of the music to a screeching halt, however there are a lot of strong moments on here too. The band sounds the most strongly influenced by Coltrane (especially Ali, who worked extensively with Coltrane), though there are also hints of Dolphy, McLean, and Coleman in the music. It's definitely worth a listen.
