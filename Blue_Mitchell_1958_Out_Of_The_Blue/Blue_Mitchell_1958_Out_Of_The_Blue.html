   Blue Mitchell's "Out Of The Blue" is the second of three amazing albums that the trumpeter made for Riverside in the late 50s. (I have reviewed the other two, "Big Six" and "Blue Soul," and a compilation featuring material from all three sessions, "Blues On My Mind," for those interested.) However, if anything this is my least favorite of the three. The reason is that where "Big Six" and "Blue Soul" had polished, tight arrangements that were meticulously constructed, "Out Of The Blue" is more of a free-flowing jam session. But what a jam session it is (!) with Benny Golson on tenor sax, Wynton Kelly or Cedar Walton on piano, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass, and the great Art Blakey on drums. The standout tunes are Golson's "Blues On My Mind,""Sweet-Cakes" (which while attributed to Mitchell reminds me of another jazz standard that I just can't put my finger on at this moment) and a great version of "When The Saints Go Marching In." The CD also includes the bonus track "Studio B" which was not on the original album. For anyone who knows Blue Mitchell from his work with Horace Silver, this will be an excellent introduction to his recordings as a leader.
