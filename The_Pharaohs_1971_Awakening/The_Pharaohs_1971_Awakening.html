   The Pharaohs, a soul/jazz/funk group, were formed in 1962 out of a student band, The Jazzmen, at Crane Junior College in Chicago. This early incarnation comprised Louis Satterfield on trombone, Charles Handy on trumpet, and Don Myrick on alto saxophone. They were joined by Fred Humphrey on piano, Ernest McCarthy on bass guitar and Maurice White on drums. Satterfield, White, and Handy were studio musicians at Chess Records in Chicago.

   On the South Side of Chicago the Affro-Arts Theater offered concerts, as well as classes in music and dance. As the name suggests the theater represented the strong African-American nature of the area and the times. It was here that the Jazzmen merged with the Artistic Heritage Ensemble to form The Pharaohs.

   In 1971 the band recorded The Awakening, and in 1972 In the Basement. With cuts like The Pharaohs Love Ya'll and In the Basement these albums established The Pharaohs as a force, if only on the cult level, for several years. Many of the Afro-Sheen commercials from this period featured music of the Pharaohs.

   By the early seventies, Maurice White had had some success with the Ramsey Lewis Trio and recorded a demo with several Chicago musicians. After signing with Warner Brothers he assembled the band which was to become Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Some of the other members of the band released another album under the name Sky in 1979.

   This is drummer Maurice White’s previous group to the better-known Earth Wind &amp; Fire, and Awakening is their sole album, but this writer finds it superior to anything EW&amp;F ever did. Indeed this excellent fusion of funk and jazz is one of the genre’s best, but it shouldn’t be mixed with stuff like Hancock’s Head Hunters or Miles’ On The Corner album, because Pharaohs’ works is somehow closer to brass funk rock than to real jazz-derived fusion. Well they sound like an ethnic African or world version of Chicago or early Kool &amp; The Gang stuff, but Mombassa albums are not sonically far away either. With as much as eight wind players and some five percussion beaters (some are thankfully combining the two), you’ll easily understand just how rhythmic their 18-men music can be.

   Fast and furious percussions, funky bass and enthralling jazzy horns are opening the outstanding 8-mins Damballa, which also features some short tribal chants interventions between spell-binding trumpet and sax solos for added drama. AWESOME!! No less impressive is the almost exclusively percussion track Ibo, but unfortunately the following Tracks Of My Tears is a sappy soul Motown affair ala future Commodores, which is out of the album’s context, if you ask me. The interesting ultra-funky Black Enuff is unfortunately a little short for my tastes, but can these guys rawk, dude!!

   On the flipside, only two tracks, the first of which is the 6-mins Freedom Road, which could find space on an early Chicago album, probably where the guitar sweats out most from the group’s pores. The 13-mins+ closer Great House is the second real highlight of the album, a mainly-instrumental funky groove that allows a superb series of interplay between all concerned, but the band is really tightly bound into the given direction.

   Yes,yes this is what can be done by a band when left to their own devices and free from label constraints.The Pharaohs were a great band that blended heavy funk with a touch of free jazz and lots of African themes and spirituality.A painfully short lived project which contained future stars such as thhe hugely talented Derf Reklaw.Sounding like a solid funk ensemble one minute,a sharp cover band the next and then like the funk offspring of the Art Ensemble of Chicago.Here was a band that let everything hang out on this seminal release.Side one is all about the funk and mixes a couple of stunning cover versions with three high quality originals.Listen to a great version of "Tracks Of My Tears".Side two is where the jazz is spliced with the funk with "Great House" being the grand finale to fully highlight the wonderful power and skill of thsi band.It is this spirit and wonderful energy that is so often missing from the majority of music today.Occasionally music this good does make it to the ears of the mainstream but sadly The Pharaohs were yet another band that slipped into obscurity.

   Absolutely one of the finest funk albums of the early '70s, and one of the most unfairly neglected, 1971's Awakening is as important and exciting as any of Funkadelic's early albums from the same period. It doesn't have the mordant humor of George Clinton's best work, but these seven lengthy tracks are as powerful as early funk gets. A Chicago-based 11-piece ensemble (many members of which would go on to found Earth, Wind &amp; Fire with Maurice White), the Pharaohs were led by their five-man-strong drum section, which included future world jazz pioneer Derf Reklaw and two percussionists specializing in African drumming. This polyrhythmic powerhouse takes center stage on all of the tracks, even the jazzy, ballad-tempo version of Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles'"Tracks of My Tears." Every track is a winner, from the purely Afro-centric "Ibo" to the soulful groove of "Freedom Road," but the winner is the 13-and-a-half-minute closer, "Great House," on which the drums and horn section hurry each other along an expansive, loose-limbed groove while guitarist Yehudah Ben Israel unleashes some acid-style guitar solos similar to what Eddie Hazel was doing on tracks like Funkadelic's "Wars of Armageddon." This is as good as Afro-funk gets.
