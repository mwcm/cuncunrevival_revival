  The Jazz Rock anthem by the revolutionary pianist Masahiko Sato featuring Jiro Inagaki &amp; his progressive Jazz Rock Band, the Big Soul Media where evolve Ryo Kawasaki, Yasuo Arakawa, Tadayuki Harada, Shunzo Ohno &amp; Takeshi Inomata from the Sound limited. This versatile and prolific pianist has left his mark on the japanese jazz history thanks to several experimental projects &amp; free jazz albums, was arranger for japanese &amp; international artists, has also composed music for various television programs, films &amp; animated movies whose the best known are Miyazaki's Panda Kopanda (1972) and the cult Belladonna (1973). Masahiko Sato started as professional musician in the Masaaki Fujita Quintet (1961) and joined the Toshiyuki Miyama's New Herd Big Band in the late sixties. In 1966, he entered the Berklee College of Music in order to become arranger and formed the Masahiko Sato Trio with the bassist Yasuo Arakawa &amp; drummer Masahiko Togashi (1968-1971), recorded with it the first of three serie discs and won, for the first (Palladium), the Japan Jazz Award in the best debut album category. In 1970, with french violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, he released Astrorama (feat. Niels-Henning Ã˜rsted Pedersen, Yoshiaki Masuo &amp; Motohiko Hino) which paving the way for future international collaborations in considerable recordings as composer &amp; arranger, inter alia, for Nancy Wilson, Wayne Shorter, Roy Haynes, Gary Peacock or Art Farmer, played also with Yohsuke Yamashita, for the singers Yoshiko Gotoh &amp; Hirota Mieko, Motohiko Hino, Anthony Braxton or Hank Jones. In 1971, he formed the Sound Breakers featuring drummer Louis Hayes with whom released the experimental Free/Jazz Fusion album Amalgamation and joined in 1975, the Electro Keyboard Orchestra group alongside Yuji Ohno, Hiromasa Suzuki &amp; Masao Yagi. In the late seventies, he participated with Hiromasa Suzuki, to the Tri Piano project created by Norio Maeda which released Pianic Pianism &amp; Super Tri Piano (both recorded in 1977). Masahiko Satoh plays here in a groovy approach with free improvisations &amp; sophisticated arrangements associated to the psychedelic expressions of Ryo Kawasaki plus the powerful skills of a swinging Inomata (as the great drum solo on Sniper's Snooze), all backed by the Soul Media Big Band led by Jiro Inagaki. Titles include three originals composed by Satoh, the Pop cover Bridge Over Troubled Water from Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Al Kooper' Somethin Goin On and the Psychedelic Soul tune Love &amp; Peace. All tracks arranged by Masahiko Satoh.
