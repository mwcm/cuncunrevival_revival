   Five 70+ minute CDs (plus a bonus CD EP) of music recorded between 1971-73, and '79.  Most interesting is the full, two-disc version of Kokkyou Junreika.  While I still prefer the official version for its condensed power and anime cover, the complete version is awesome in its own right, with plenty of great tracks that didn't make the final cut.  Significantly less engaging is the '79 recording, which sounds like a soundtrack to a children's film, and is padded with filler.  In between are two good, but not spectacular, CDs featuring material from '71 and '72.  Listening to this, and the other Seazer sets, you definitely get the feeling that the best stuff was already released.  A recurring problem is that many tracks go on far too long.  Still, a Seazer fan is definitely going to want this set for the full version of Kokkyou Junreika, and will probably find the rest to be worth an occasional listen.  And whenever you feel bored with the music you can look at the pictures, or try deciphering the extensive Japanese liner notes.

   The Tenjo Sajiki Company was an avant garde theater group and in Japan in the 60's and 70's these groups were the source of some interesting progressive music releases. Tenjo Sajiki tkes their name from Marcel Carne's story Les Enfants Du Paradis and was originally formed by Shuji Terayama. Under Shuji the music was often reminiscent of Magma.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Shuji died in 1983 and the group disbanded. J.A. Ceasar a member of this band kept the spririt of this theater/play party by starting up 'Banyu Inryoku.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Tenjō Sajiki, also Tenjou Sajiki (天井桟敷, Tenjō Sajiki), was a Japanese independent theater troupe co-founded by Shūji Terayama, Kujō Kyōko, Yutaka Higashi, Tadanori Yokoo, and Fumiko Takagi.[1]
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   It was led by Shūji Terayama and active between 1967 and 1983 (until Terayama's death). A major phenomenon on the Japanese underground scene, the group has produced a number of stage works marked by experimentalism, folklore influences, social provocation, grotesque eroticism and the flamboyant fantasy characteristic of Terayama's oeuvre. Tenjō Sajiki benefitted greatly from collaborations with a number of prominent artists, including musicians J. A. Seazer and Kan Mikami, and graphic designers Aquirax Uno and Tadanori Yokoo.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

   The name is from 天井桟敷の人々, the Japanese title of the film Children of Paradise.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   J.A. Caesar (also spelled J.A. Seazer and J.A. Ceaser) is the pseudonym for a Tokyo music composer who has been involved with creating music for various theater and film projects since the very early '70s. His music is a radical mixture of progressive rock, traditional Japanese theater music, and Magma-inspired Zeuhl music. In fact, Caesar's flirtation with Zeuhl long predates the similar Zeuhl influences on many later Japanese groups like Ruins, Bondage Fruit, and Koenji Hyakkei.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In the very early '70s, Caesar aligned himself with legendary experimental theater director Shuji Terayama. Terayama was also a film director, poet, artist, and cultural agitator, and had been writing movie screenplays since 1960. Caesar became musical director for Terayama's theater company, Tenjo Sajiki, as well as the soundtrack artist for most of Terayama's films in the early '70s and onward. Caesar's first appearance on record was with the Tokyo Kid Brothers, another experimental theater troupe formed by Yutaka Higashi; Caesar composed some tracks on their 1971 LP Throw Away the Books, Let's Go into the Streets (Sho O Suteyo, Machi Deyo). This album is the soundtrack to either the movie or the play with the same name by Terayama. The next year, the Victor label released Tenjousajiki: Jasoumon, a live recording of one of Terayama's theater productions, under J.A. Caesar's name.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Throughout the '70s and into the early '80s, Caesar worked with Terayama on theater events that blended traditional Japanese Noh theater with experimental progressive rock. Other records from Terayama's plays were Recital, Kokkyo Junreika (originally issued in 1973), Ship of Fools (1977) on the Nippon Columbia label, and Shintokumaru on the Victor label the next year -- all these records offering intense music with weird choruses and rhythms. Caesar also composed the soundtracks for several experimental and surrealist films directed by Terayama at this time, including Pastoral Hide and Seek (Den 'en Ni Shisu) in 1975, which was a competing film in the Cannes Film Festival.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   When Terayama passed away in 1983, Caesar took over the theater company and renamed it Banyu Inryoku, and though it has kept Terayama's vision intact, not much new was issued on record until the late '90s, when Caesar resurfaced as the soundtrack artist to several anime films including Revolutionary Girl Utena and the soundtrack to Hiromichi Tannai's film Pilgrimage of Blood in 2001.

   Put this on some day and it could possibly change your entire perspective on music. Brilliant collection and stunning album artwork.
