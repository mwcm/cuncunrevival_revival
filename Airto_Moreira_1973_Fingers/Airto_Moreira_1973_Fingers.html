   Airto Moreira is the outstanding percussionist of the era and brought the role into the foreground of the music, enlarging the customary battery of instruments with his influential approach. His array may include, for example: congas, bongos, talking drum, maracas, temple blocks, timbales, gong, vibraphone, djembe, whistles, conch shell, tabla, marimba, beat box and of course his vocal acrobatics (many of these feature here). Having played on some seminal jazz albums with Miles Davis, Chick Corea, Cannonball Adderley and Weather Report, he went on to make his own landmark release with Fingers. Here Airto combines his trademark mardi gras-style energy and excitement with a sublime set of songs. And bringing in the Uraguayan band Opa makes for a brilliant and organic ensemble with just over half an hour of distilled magic.

   We begin with the compulsively danceable Fingers, with Airto's fevered chorus as the band rallies around in celebration - throughout these pieces Airto's percussive poly-rhythms and unique scat-chanting thrill. Merry-Go-Round has some carnival organ to carry the joyful tune as Hugo Fattoruso on keyboards brings some distinctive latin flavours to this record. Airto's wife Flora Purim contributes some sensual vocals on her beautiful and haunting San Francisco River, my favourite composition here - a moonstruck performance that floats by so elegantly with Flora's unique siren call. It all comes together on the last song, Tombo in 7/4, where an unusual tempo builds to a euphoric samba-rock finale. Fingers has it's own special atmosphere and I love this addictive album. The track sequencing makes for a unified recording aided by the engineering of the great Rudy Van Gelder.

   This is one of the treasures of the CTI record label and perhaps the defining release for Airto Moreira. Essential!
