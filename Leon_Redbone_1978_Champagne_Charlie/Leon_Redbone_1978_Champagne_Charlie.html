   From the opening track, "Champagne Charlie," to the dazzling finale, "T.B. Blues," Leon Redbone presents an introspective collection of blues and big band melodies in timeless fashion, a rare feat because of its release date in 1978. The record was highly acclaimed and regarded as the purest of jazz and classic blues by a remarkable legend and icon in this musical form. Most of the record, like the amiable "Sweet Sue (Just You)" and memorable "Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)," is filled with the best that blues and ragtime has to offer. The music itself is quite light and jolly during the more uplifting moments, with others such as "I Hate a Man Like You" very depressing and sorrowful. The band backing up Redbone is delightful, filled with jubilant horns, oboes, and trumpets. "T.B. Blues" closes out this record as a charming look back into the world of blues via pioneer Jimmie Rodgers. Two melodies written and composed by giant Jelly Roll Morton are featured here, with fresh and stunning new arrangements by Leon Redbone and company, "If Someone Would Only Love Me" and "I Hate a Man Like You." The record is somewhat poorly recorded, losing its listening ability though still portraying its exuberant style and antique mysteriousness. A charming and romantic listen and study of this period of ragtime and blues that will surely not disappoint the average listener.

   This is one of the best Leon Redbone recordings as far as I am concerned. It was the first one I bought on vinyl and began my interest in the wonderful melange of blues, ragtime, Tin Pan Alley classics and vaudeville numbers that he purveyed. I had listened to enough crackling 78s from the period he drew on to love his re-creations from the past that interpreted them brilliantly. (I derived a lot of innocent enjoyment by sandwiching a Leon Redbone album between two vintage recordings and seeing if anyone except guitarists noticed. )

   Leon is in great form on this one, helped by some excellent sidesmen and really good production where the pace is never pushed and his voice and guitar are supported rather than being overwhelmed.

   There are many excellent tracks on this cd. The two outstanding tracks for me are Jelly Roll Morton's I Hate A Man Like You and Jimmie Rodgers T.B. Blues which showcase his voice and finger-picking to great effect. The cd itself came as a pleasant surprise. The sound quality is actually better than that on my vinyl copy without having been remastered. So although I bought the cd for convenience sake I am thrilled to now own a better quality recording and highly recommend it.
