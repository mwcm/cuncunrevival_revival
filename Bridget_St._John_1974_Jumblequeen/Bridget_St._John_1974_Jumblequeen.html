  With all the songs fitting together seamlessly,this album makes a distinct impact. Supported from the beginning by well known DJ John Peel,St. John's albums were critical favorites. And while they never sold in large quantities,she had a reputation as one of Britain's finest singer/songwriters. This album is a reflection of St. John's life,which was in turmoil at this point,and that's what lifts this album above her others. It's still amazing that an artist of her caliber is still unknown. She deserves to be heard by everyone who likes well written,arranged,and masterfully sung songs. While "Jumblequeen" is considered St. John's finest work-all her albums from this era contain a number of equally fine songs,beautifully arranged. She deserves better. Listen and find out for yourself.
