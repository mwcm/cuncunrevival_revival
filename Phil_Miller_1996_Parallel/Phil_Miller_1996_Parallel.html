  Legendary guitarist Phil Miller and his In Cahoots ensemble have been active on the Canterbury / Jazz scene since the 1980s, constantly changing lineups but always producing music of the highest quality. A vehicle for presenting Miller’s intricate and highly sophisticated compositions, the ensemble’s recorded legacy through the years – both studio and live – is a great example of European Jazz. This album was recorded by a sextet, which consists of Miller – guitar and guitar synthesizer, Elton Dean – saxophones, Jim Dvorak – trumpet, Peter Lemer – keyboards, Fred Baker – bass and Pip Pyle – drums, who need no introduction all being already much respected and admired musicians. All that remains is to relax and enjoy this wonderful music played by simply the best musicians imaginable. Highly recommended!
