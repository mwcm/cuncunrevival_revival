   If the band that Japan delivered for the field of Rock and prog Rock of Japan of the 70's is enumerated, the existence of this Yoninbayashi might be a band that had surely left one shape and history. Part of distinguished services to establish what should be of Rock in the 70's for band in Japan perhaps. And, they are situations of Rock that Japan thinks about in an overseas market as the band that informs them of the existence at the dawn. It influenced various musicians who followed back as a band that made music that supported them an embodiment, too.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   The start of this band goes back to 1971. There was a part to which their music characters had already been established. Point that Pink Floyd and ELP had already influenced them as the respect. There was a situation where a lot of main currents of the Folk music and psychedelic existed for the market of the music of Japan in the 70's, too. Yoninbayashi had already carried a sense of direction as one of the bands that had established the music character that had to be called Prog Rock exactly in the situation. And, it was guitar player's Katsutoshi Morizono to show directionality to their music concretely. The music character with he had decided the directionality of the band to some degree. It appears remarkably by their albums to say nothing of it. The expression of the music character of "Isshoku- Sokuhatsu" that they had them announce in 1974 can listen to following the music character that exactly looks like Pink Floyd at that time. In addition, it expresses it in the music character that they were having them establish it in "Golden Picnics" announced in 1976 as a part where the unique culture of Japan was united.

   There was some members' replacements after this band had formed. However, the music character established at first of the formation was advanced well. However, it will have been a reflection of the music character of Katsutoshi Morizono that had decided the music character of the band to some degree as the result. At that time, the fan of the listener and this band evaluates the album of the period high. The evaluation was widespread to an overseas musician and parties concerned further. And, it is a situation of some members' replacements as the result with the evaluation of their initial works. Or, as for the secession of the band by Katsutoshi Morizono to have decided the directionality of the band, this band inevitably constructs the flow with which following new directionality and a past work is laced. And, "Printed Jelly" of their.. third alubum faces one transition stage for Yoninbayashi.

   Mitsuru Satoh of the guitar player newly invited by the band is made remarks that uneasiness was held for the process and the expression of the production of this album. As for the expression of the self to following the established music character and the deriving directionality and opening individuality, uneasiness and the expectation might have crossed each other. Their music characters have been passed as music refined further by this member's replacement. The music character at this time is music refined further in the age against uniting the element of music to be Interior Minister partial till then and to absorb. Music with the sense of relief that may leave a good element while following a past music character is blocked in this album. The music that is reminiscent of Pink Floyd and Kestrel will be Music with whom following and an original viewpoint to the music character that they have already done were united well.

   "Ha-Ra-So-Ra" has been passed as a suitable tune so that they may have them execute a new music character. The tune is Rock with the sense of relief very much. The tune advances while continuing a straight melody. I might not be able to feel a past music character in this tune so much. However, the part of straight Rock and the song by solo of the keyboard and a new guitar player is expressed as a result of the band's developing new directionality. Coming in succession of solo of the guitar to get on the rhythm of Latin is devised well.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   As for "A Day In The Afternoon", Rock of the city type very refined is developed. An Interior Minister part exists together to the sense of relief in the melody. Jonesy and Kestrel might be recollected as an impression. However, it is straight Rock with basically a little expression of feelings. The work of the keyboard also has a little progressive part.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In "Cythere", the melody of a beautiful guitar and the song is feature ballade. Lyrics are the songs of the sailor who aims at the Arcadia village. There is a part where Pink Floyd is recollected a little as a melody. The continuation of an effect of solo of the whistle and a gentle melody is impressive.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   In "N*Y*C*R*R*M", the rhythm with the sound and the dash feeling of a progressive keyboard is a feature. The part of a powerful song and straight Rock and Roll shows the part where their music was converted further and opened. Part of solo of guitar to get on Chord with expression of feelings. The opened expression is expressed well. I feel the part where Thin Lizzy in the 80 a little's is reminiscent as the impression.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "Caprice and Grace" is a tune from which the music character that they had completely done in the past is followed enough. Part of complete song and chorus who gets on melody of refined city type. The atmosphere of the tune has been decided to the piano and the guitar to express expression of feelings a little. The negotiation on solo of a progressive keyboard and solo of the guitar is expressed well. The continuousness of five rhythms in the part of Coda might be a good flow.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The Violet Storm" is expressed attended with shape being refined for the music character that they had them establish it. The tune gives moving development because it introduced the melody of grand symphonic into an acoustic part. Pink Floyd might be recollected to this tune a little.
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   <br/>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   Their music characters developed newer directionality from this album through the replacement of the member. Their music characters have the opinion of the approval or disapproval by the album. However, this album shows the existence as a band that they had them advocate the shape of Prog Rock of Japan.
