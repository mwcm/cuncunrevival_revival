  Rare unreleased psychedelic material by this great Scottish band who were regulars at Middle Earth etc in the '60s. Subtitled 'A History Of Writing On The Wall', this 1995 release is a great retrospective compilation covering the career of this late 60's to early 70's band from Edinburgh who released a true prog classic with 1969's 'The Power Of The Picts'. Stoned psychedelic rock with a twisted dark side.
