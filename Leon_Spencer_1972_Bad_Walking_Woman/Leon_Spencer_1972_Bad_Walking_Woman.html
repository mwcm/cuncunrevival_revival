   Supremely heavy work from organist Leon Spencer – one of his classic jazz funk sessions for Prestige Records, and a record that shows him opening up his sound a bit more than before! The album has Spencer working in a few different lineups – some with small groups that feature Melvin Sparks on guitar and Idris Muhammad on drums – others with some slightly larger instrumentation and even a bit of strings, used in a sophisticatedly soulful style that reminds us a bit of CTI or Kudu backings of the time! Billy Ver Planck handles the larger arrangements, but even on these Leon's organ is right out front in the mix – really dominating the tunes, and soaring over the top with a newly fluid style that reminds us of Charles Earland at his own best during this time.

   The reviews at the time were not very good. Leon's previous work was in the organ combo niche of the time (MacDuff, Scott, Wilson, McGriff for example). The bad / lackluster reviews had to do with the inclusion of strings and Hubert Laws on a few tracks. Ironically those tracks are what earned the album 5 stars from me! I was not a fan of the gospel flavored funk of the period so the lush romantic feel of the ballads here ( very ordinary arrangements) were a welcome change for me. I recently got a 2 on one 'acid jazz' cd with more of Spencer's work on the PRESTIGE/FANTASY label, but this remains the best album from Spencer for me.
