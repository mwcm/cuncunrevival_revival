   One of the early Black Saint albums, this set features a reunion between soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy and trombonist Roswell Rudd; bassist Ken Carter and drummer Beaver Harris complete the quartet. Although Lacy and Rudd had had a group 15 years earlier that exclusively played Thelonious Monk tunes, in this case they perform five of Lacy's diverse originals, stretching themselves on such tunes as "Trickles" and "Robes." The music is less melodic than expected but does have its moments of interest

   This is a very solid record reuniting him with Roswell Rudd, whom--as other commentators note--Lacy had previously hooked up with for a Monk-centric band which never managed to release a full-length LP until long after they disbanded (the product is School Days). Rudd and Lacy would later collaborate again on records heavy with Monk's music, including Regeneration and Monk's Dream. Here, they only play Lacy's tunes, which generally split the difference between his Beefheart-gone-jazz moments and his, well, Monk-ian or even Ayler-ian stuff; this is nowhere more evident than on the title track/opener, which features a very long head (if you want to think about it that way, though it lasts at least two minutes) which has some grinding, almost post-punk-ian stabs and a dizzying Dixieland component, while the solo section features some of Lacy's most straightforwardly-pretty playing, sometimes punctuated by Rudd's out gargling.

   "I Feel a Draught" takes things in a decidedly freer direction, with mimicking the titular wind, with Ken Carter (presumably) bowing his bass rather squeakily and Lacy blowing some lowy, very breathy/aspirated notes, while Harris produces a rumbling toms background. This really isn't so far from a certain electro-acoustic improvisation aesthetic, although Lacy interjects some insistent, simple melodies (modulated up and down a step here or there)--but this is largely timbral, not melodic or harmonic.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
   "The Bite" returns to the odd world of the title, with Lacy and Rudd playing a theme that's hooky but slightly discordant; it's a little hard for me to tell what's going on, but I hear the two of them playing the same notes for the most part but sometimes one or the other or will play a note that's in the right key and changes the melody slightly but sounds dissonant with the playing of the other; the masterful thing is that Carter gets in on this, creating a tricky three-part harmony that tickles the brain. As with many Lacy heads, this isn't so much the brief establishing theme that prepares the listener for extended soloing, but an attraction in itself which lasts for a couple of minutes; Harris absolutely bashes the shit out of his kit, playing in a way that is (as his furiously deft soloing soon makes clear) purposefully simplistic and heavy. But, eventually things do loosen up, with the solo section taking a collective improv approach; Lacy's sax, oddly for a jazz saxophonist, actually anchors the proceedings, playing fairly melodic (if sometimes overblown and screechy) figures, while Harris goes nuts in the background (in a very entertaining way), with Rudd and Carter splitting the difference with sometimes minimal, sometimes quite noisy improv.

   "Papa's Midnite Hop" almost has a Sun Ra-ish vibe, in that its straightforwardly bop harmony almost sounds noir-ish (Cf. Ra's "Saturn"). As with some of Lacy's septet records, there's an odd fusion-ish vibe to the proceedings; while Lacy sometimes seemed in direct conversation with no wave and post-punk at some points, I'm not aware of any direct link he had to mainstream rock music or many times that he used electronic instruments (he had plenty of weird instruments on his records, but I'm struggling to remember any with a Rhodes or electric bass), but sometimes his group playing has a simplicity that sounds contemporary with a certain kind of fusion. Here, Harris and Carter lay down a slinky groovy that could have come from one of krautrock's many vaguely "ethnic" experiments (note my heavy scarequoting). After the very catchy head, the solo section gets pretty out, with Lacy free-blowing his head off in that same controlled, very breathy way explored on "Draught"; it's actually rather quiet, but it sounds mad, sort of like the kind of music Gene Hackman should have been playing in The Conversation--but Rudd's solo is actually quite pretty, playing languidly with the opening melody (was there some rule that these two made for this record that when the other reached a moment of conventional tonality, the other had to do some crazy e-ai stuff in the background? Lace does that "you can only hear my breath and the faintest high-pitched note" thing in the background for all of Rudd's solo). While Carter's bass is purposefully very minimal here, Harris' drums achieve a certain excellent Liebezeit-ian slow burn here--the rhythm is rock-steady (pun intended), but it's accented in a distinctively "jazz" fashion (read: more interesting than rock drumming). I think I hear him playing the ride with his hands or mallets after the sixth minute.

   Finally, "Robes" is one of Lacy's better-documented tunes, being one of the tunes played in the few video recordings of him on Youtube. An odd set of chimes play a key role in the main theme here (in the video in question, Lacy operates them with a pedal, although Hank Shteamer's review on Dark Forces Swing Blind Punches suggests that Rudd played them), along with some lovely ballad playing from the horns; as with A1 and A3, there's one of Lacy's patented cartoonish loops here, this time sitting between the prettier head and the improv section (instead of serving as the head). But the soloing takes a decidedly beautiful turn, with Harris playing one of his few conventional bop-ish rhythms while Carter establishes a gorgeous humming drone. While Rudd and Lacy noodle around in a pleasantly craggy way, Carter takes up a lot of sonic space here and manages some really pretty improv, although Lacy's solo that comes in around 6:13 really cooks as well, with Harris matching the intensity with some heavy filling. I just love Lacy's style: the meditative, squealing, leaping approach he takes shouldn't sound so pretty, but it does.
