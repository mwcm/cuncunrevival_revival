  Showcasing Akkerman`s heavier side, From The Basement is full of suprises from a Reggae version of Bob Dylan`s All Along The Watchtower with Dino Walcott on vocals to an extended jam at the end of the CD which will blow you completely away. Jan just let`s her rip for 15 minutes. A heavier updated version of an oldie but a goldie appears in the form of of Dark Rose from the Brainbox days, with Kaz Lux dropping in to provide the vocal power. In a more thoughtful track Jan pays a mesmerizing musical tribute to Raoul Wallenberg using the Roland synth axe to great advantage. The remaining tracks signal a return to the old- style electric guitar wizadry Akkerman was known for while playing in Focus in the seventies ( sorry no lutes here folks ).
  <br/>
  Fans of Akkerman`s unique approach to the electric guitar will not be dis-appointed with this one. Additions on the HUX CD offerring includes outakes from the " Basement " sessions as well as other subsequently recorded material along with liner notes from the Dutch Master himself. Put the headphones on and crank this one up to eleven!
